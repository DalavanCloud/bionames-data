Repertorium


"Repertorium specierum novarum regni vegetabilis" (Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg.) and "Repertorium specierum novarum regni vegetabilis. Beihefte" (Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg. Beih.) are not the same thing, they have different volume numbering, and only one has DOIs. Early volumes of both are in BHL as http://biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/276 and http://biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6505 


Botanical Magazine

ecent issues have DOis (renamed journal). Older ones are in j-stage, but by crude atempt at OpenURL lookup fails on early issues because I get the Japanese articles which are different! Treat all J-Stage URLs as suspect :(
