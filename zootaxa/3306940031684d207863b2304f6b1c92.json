Hydrothelphusa vencesi n. sp. is clearly distinguished from\nits congeners by its distinctive first gonopod (G1) with a terminal article that is in the form of a long straight-sided cone,\nand by a dorsal membrane at the segment junction of G1 that is broad and diamond-shaped. A key is provided to separate\nthe five species of Hydrothelphusa.\nKey words: Crustacea, Brachyura, Potamoidea, Potamonautidae, Hydrothelphusa, freshwater crab, taxonomy, new spe-\ncies, Madagascar\nIntroduction\nThe present work was prompted by the examination of freshwater crabs from a forested area in the mountains\nof southeastern Madagascar that were collected by Prof. Dr. Miguel Vences and his colleagues and sent to the\nauthors for identification. The specimens were collected from the Vevembe Forest, over 60 km inland from\nFarafangana in Fianarantsoa Province. The new material included specimens of a taxon that is described here\nas a new species and assigned to the genus Hydrothelphusa A. Milne-Edwards, 1872, based on both morpho-\nlogical evidence and on a molecular study of this Malagasy genus by Thompson (2005).\nThere are currently 13 species of freshwater crabs in Madagascar assigned to 7 genera (Cumberlidge &\nSternberg 2002; Reed & Cumberlidge 2006). The addition of Hydrothelphusa vencesi n. sp. brings the num-\nber of species of Malagasy freshwater crabs to 14, all of which are endemic to the island. The genus\nHydrothelphusa now includes five species \u2014H. agilis A. Milne-Edwards, 1872, H. madagascariensis (A.\nMilne-Edwards, 1872), H. bombetokensis Rathbun, 1904, H. goudoti (H. Milne Edwards, 1853), and H. venc-\nesi n. sp. (Bott 1965) (see Cumberlidge & Sternberg 2002; Cumberlidge et al. 2004; Cumberlidge et al. 2005;\nReed & Cumberlidge 2006).\nBott (1965) assigned Malagasy freshwater crabs to two different families, the-then Potamonidae Ort-\nmann, 1897, and the Gecarcinucidae Rathbun, 1904. In contrast, the revision by Cumberlidge and Sternberg\n(2002) included all of the Malagasy freshwater crab genera in the African family Potamonautidae Bott, 1970,\nbased on shared character states of the mandibular palp, abdomen, and first gonopod, and treated these taxa as\na monophyletic group. Recent molecular studies have provided evidence that the Malagasy freshwater crab\ngenera indeed form a monophyletic clade (Thompson 2005; Daniels et al. 2006; Klaus et al. 2006). However,\n\f",
    "CUMBERLIDGE ET AL.\n62 \u00b7 Zootaxa 1524 \u00a9 2007 Magnolia Press\ndifferent classifications of the Malagasy freshwater crabs have been proposed (Klaus et al. 2006; Cumber-\nlidge et al. 2007). Until a new consensus on the higher taxonomy can be reached the classification used here is\nthat of Martin & Davis (2001).\nAbbreviations. The following abbreviations are used: cw = the distance across the carapace at the widest\npoint; cl = carapace length measured along the median line, from the anterior to the posterior margin; ch = car-\napace height, the maximum height of the cephalothorax above the sternum; fw = front width, the width of the\nfront measured along the anterior margin between the orbits; s = thoracic sternite; e = episternite; s4\/s5, s4\/s5,\ns5\/s6, s6\/s7, s7\/s8 = sternal sutures between adjacent thoracic sternites; s4\/e4, s5\/e5, s6\/e6, s7\/e7 = episternal\nsutures between adjacent sternites and episternites; G1 = gonopod 1; G2 = gonopod 2; a1 to a6 = abdominal\nsegments 1 to 6; t = telson of abdomen; p1 to p5 = pereiopods 1 to 5; asl = height in metres above sea level;\nFMNH = Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL, USA; NMU = Northern Michigan University, Mar-\nquette, MI, USA; ZMA = Zo\u00f6logisch Museum Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nSystematic account\nFamily Potamonautidae Bott, 1970\nGenus Hydrothelphusa A.

Endemic to Madagascar. Hydrothelphusa vencesi is known from three localities in south-\neastern Madagascar, two of them in the Mananara River drainage basin. The type locality is in the Vevembe\nForest near the village of Vevembe in the region of Vondrozo in Fianarantsoa Province. This species is also\nfound in the Sahavatov River which is part of the drainage basin of the Manampatrana River (Andringita\nCamp II, 1,390 m asl), and at 570 m asl in the Sahambano River in the basin of the Mananara-sud River.\nRemarks. The following morphological characters justify including H. vencesi in Hydrothelphusa (Cum-\nberlidge & Sternberg 2002: 47; Thompson 2005). The carapace outline is transversely oval with wide frontal\nand posterior margins (each approximately one-third carapace width); the mandibular palp is two-segmented\nwith a lobe-like, medium-sized anterior process (about one-third the size of the terminal segment) at the junc-\ntion between the segments; the ischium of the third maxilliped has a deep vertical sulcus, and the exopod of\nthe third maxilliped has a long flagellum; sternal sulcus s2\/s3 is deep and horizontal, and sternal sulcus s3\/s4\nis shallow and V-shaped; episternal sulci s4\/e4, s5\/e5, s6\/e6, s7\/e7 are smooth and not visible; walking legs\n(p2\u2013p5) are neither shortened nor elongated, with the ratio of the length of the merus of p5 to the cw of 0.40\u2013\n0.45; the male abdomen is long, slim, and triangular, with a bell-shaped telson whose sides are indented; the\nterminal article of G1 is long (with a ratio of the length of the terminal article to the subterminal segment of\n0.3); the subterminal segment of G1 has a distinct disto-lateral triangular shoulder-like projection at the junc-\ntion of the segments; and G2 is longer than G1 with a terminal article that has a long flagellum (the ratio of the\nlength of the terminal article to the subterminal segment is approximately 0.8).\nEtymology. The species is named for Prof. Dr. Miguel Vences in recognition of his important contribu-\ntions to our knowledge of the diversity, evolution, and natural history of Madgascar\u2019s endemic fauna.\n\f",

Hydrothelphusa vencesi can be distinguished from other species of Hydrothelphsua (and\nindeed from all other Malagasy brachyurans) by examination of G1 morphology (Figs. 10\u201315). The terminal\narticle of G1 of H. vencesi is a long straight-sided cone that tapers evenly to a pointed tip and lacks a pro-\nnounced raised mid section; in addition there is a broad diamond-shaped dorsal membrane at the segment\njunction on its dorsal side. These characters are unique to H. vencesi and set this taxon apart from the other\nspecies assigned to this genus (see below) (Cumberlidge & Sternberg 2002: 48\u201359, fig. 9A\u2013Q).\n\f",

The frontal margin, front behind the margin, and the suborbital, subhepatic,\nand pterygostomial regions of the carapace sidewall are all distinctly granulated, the exorbital and epibran-\nchial teeth are both large and pointed, and the anterolateral margin behind the epibranchial tooth is either\nheavily granulated or toothed; the suborbital margin, the ischium of pereiopod 1, and the inferior margins of\nmerus of pereiopod 1 are also granulated. Hydrothelphusa vencesi differs from H. madagascariensis in that\nthe G1 terminal article of H. vencesi is a long straight-sided evenly-tapering cone that lacks the pronounced\nraised mid-section seen in H. madagascariensis (Figs. 10\u201315; Cumberlidge & Sternberg 2002: figs. 9E\u2013I).\nHydrothelphusa vencesi shares the following characters with H. bombetokensis. The exorbital and epi-\nbranchial teeth are both large and pointed and the first carpal tooth on the carpus of pereiopod 1 is a long, slen-\nder spine. Hydrothelphusa vencesi can be distinguished from H. bombetokensis as follows. The inferior\nmargins of the merus of pereiopod 1 of H. bombetokensis are granular (whereas these margins in H. vencesi\nhave several large and pointed teeth); the anterior carapace of H. bombetokensis is smooth (whereas that of H.\nvencesi is heavily granulated in the anterolateral corners and the frontal region); and the G1 terminal article of\nH. bombetokensis is slim and distinctly raised in the mid-section (the result of a higher medial fold) ending in\nan upcurved tip (Cumberlidge & Sternberg 2002: figs. 9J\u2013M), whereas that of P. vencesi is a long straight-\nsided evenly-tapering cone that lacks the pronounced raised mid-section (Figs. 10\u201315).\nHydrothelphusa vencesi is similar to H. agilis in that the frontal margin of both of these large species is\nnoticeably indented in the middle.
