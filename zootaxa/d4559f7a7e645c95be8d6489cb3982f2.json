SVL, AGL and TL were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm with a steel ruler; the other\nmeasurements were taken with dial calipers, viewed under a dissecting microscope, to the nearest 0.1 mm.\nThe following meristic characters were counted on each individual in Australian collections: number of\nenlarged scales in a row on the ventral surface of the femoro-precloacal area, counted along the most posterior\nenlarged row of the femoral area; number of pores along the scales in this row, when present, and the number of\nscales involved in breaks in the pore-bearing series; longitudinal rows of ventral scales counted transversely across\nthe mid-point of the axilla-groin interval, between ventrolateral skin folds and including the scales to the peak of\nthe fold; number of longitudinal rows of enlarged tubercles across the body dorsum, at the midpoint of the axilla-\ngroin interval; number of supralabial scales, counted from the first scale posterior to the rostral scale, posteriorly to\nthe point at which the scale row tilts dorsally posteroventral to the eye; number of infralabial scales, counted from\nthe first scale posterior to the mental scale, posteriorly to the last enlarged scale.

This method of counting subdigital lamellae often included some scales on the sole of the\nfoot rather than just those below the phalanges. However, this method was adopted due to the difficulty in deter-\nmining exactly where to commence counting on the digit, due to the slight webbing at the base of some digits. We\ncounted lamellae on only one foot per specimen; usually the left, unless damage or distortion made it necessary to\nexamine the right foot.\nFor specimens from institutions outside Australia, we counted and measured a reduced set of characters: SVL,\nventral scales and enlarged femoroprecloacal scales and pores, together with the number and configuration of dark\nbands on body and tail.\nMorphological analyses. To test the hypothesis that the Australian Cyrtodactylus represent one extremity of a\ncline of variation in a widespread taxon C. louisiadensis, we studied the pattern of geographic variation in femoro-\nprecloacal pores within C. louisiadensis sensu lato. The distribution of this broader entity was represented by three\narcs running from north-west to south-east: the northernmost from Bougainville to the Solomon Islands (5\u00ba S 154\u00ba\nE to 9\u00ba S 160\u00ba E), the second along the northern New Guinea coast, and south-east through the Louisiade Archipel-\nago (6\u00ba S 146\u00ba E to 11\u00ba S 154\u00ba E), and the southernmost along the north-east Australian coast and ranges (12\u00ba S\n143\u00ba E to 17\u00ba S 145\u00ba E) (Fig. 2). We plotted femoroprecloacal pore number in each arc against longitude for the two\nnorthern arcs (as the range of longitude was greater than for latitude in both, and longitude and latitude were corre-\nlated) and against latitude for the Australian arc, to explore the nature of the relationship and regressed pore count\nagainst the same variables with simple linear regression. As two populations (in the south in Australia, and on Mis-\nima Island in New Guinea) had gaps in the femoroprecloacal pores series, and as pores were only present in males,\nwe also considered the pattern of variation in each arc for total number of enlarged femoroprecloacal scales (allow-\ning us to exclude the gaps, and increase the samples by inclusion of females), and for number of transventral scales,\nwhich should also be affected in the same way in each arc if a general cline existed from high numbers of less\nenlarged scales in the north to small numbers of more enlarged scales in the south.\nTABLE 4.

Sexes were analysed separately where sexual dimorphism was\npresent, and pooled where sexual dimorphism was not present. Most characters showed significant allometry\n(Tables 4, 5). The effect of allometry was removed by converting the measurements to the values they would\nassume for an animal of average size, treating the sexes separately when sexual dimorphism was present, using the\nmethods of Thorpe (1975). Mean values of SVL and HL (used as the independent variables for transforming other\nmeasurements) for the Cooktown lineage were very close to the overall means for the entire Australian Cyrtodacty-\nlus sample, and the range of variation for the Cooktown lineage extensively overlapped the overall range for Aus-\ntralian samples. As the other Australian lineages were represented by many fewer specimens and in some cases\nnarrow size ranges, precluding assessments of sexual dimorphism and allometry for those lineages, we used the\ndata for the Cooktown lineage alone to transform the values for all Australian samples.\nFor scalational characters and adjusted measurements, we first tested for the presence of differences between\nmeans of the genetic lineages by one-way analysis of variance, and only considered characters for the multivariate\nanalyses that showed significant differences among the lineages. We chose to include in the multivariate analyses a\nset of four scalational characters (femoroprecloacal scales, transventral scales, longitudinal rows of dorsal tuber-\ncles, total lamellae below fourth toe), one untransformed measurement (SVL), and nine transformed measurements\n(adjusted AGL, TW, HLL, HW, HD, IN, EN, EE, EAR). This number of characters is sufficiently large to approxi-\nmate the total pattern of variation (Thorpe 1989). Some additional characters that showed significant lineage differ-\nences were excluded because they showed low variation (e.g., labial scales) or showed similar patterns of variation\nto characters included (e.g., other toe lamellae counts, FLL (cf. HLL), SL (cf. EN)). We also were unable to include\nin the analyses some categorical features of scalation and coloration that distinguished genetic lineages. Two anal-\nyses were run, one for females, one for males. For the female analysis, all five lineages were treated as operational\ntaxonomic units (OTUs), while for the male analysis only four lineages were treated as OTUs. The single male\nindividual from the Tozer's Gap lineage was treated as of unknown identity.\nRESULTS\nGenetics\nAustralian taxa. The Bayesian consensus tree (Fig. 3) clearly shows that Australian Cyrtodactylus populations\nrepresent five completely supported lineages corresponding to geographically constrained clusters (Pascoe River,\nTozer's Gap, McIlwraith Range, a broad group centred over Cooktown, and a southern group extending to Chilla-\ngoe) with posterior probabilities of 1.00 for all five groups. These five lineages formed two major clusters, one\nconsisting of the Pascoe River and McIlwraith populations, the other of the Tozer's Gap, Cooktown and Chilla-\ngoe\u2013Mungana Caves lineages. Average uncorrected sequence divergence within each of the five Australian lin-\neages ranged from 0.00% (Pascoe River) up to 5.78% (Chillagoe\u2013Mungana Caves) (Table 2). Among the\nAustralian lineages, average uncorrected sequence divergence estimates ranged from 8.53% (Pascoe River vs McIl-\nwraith) up to 17.72% (Tozer's Gap vs McIlwraith) (Table 2). There is marked population structuring within the\nChillagoe lineage with two strongly supported subgroups, separating the Chillagoe\u2013Mungana Caves individuals\nfrom the Parrot Creek Falls individuals located further north.\nPNG and Solomon Island taxa. The Bayesian analysis shows that the three samples from the Solomon\nIslands form a monophyletic group with posterior probability of 1.00. Given that this lineage includes the C. salo-\nmonensis holotype from Ysabel Island (though only 650bp of this individual's ND2 gene was able to be\nsequenced), all three samples were therefore considered to belong to C. salomonensis.\nThe tree also shows that the C. louisiadensis group of previous authors (i.e., the Australian lineages together\nwith C. salomonensis and the New Guinea species C. epiroticus, C. klugei, C. lousiadensis, C. robustus and C. tri-\npartitus) is not monophyletic, as at least two species (C. novaeguineae and C. zugi; posterior probability 1.00) and\npossibly four (C. sermowaiensis and C. loriae; posterior probability 0.68) are nested between the Australian and\nnon-Australian members of the putative C. louisiadensis group.\n\f",

The New Guinean species within the C. louisiadensis group differ on aver-\nage from C. salomonensis by 15.02% as opposed to 19.90% from the other PNG species. Within the New Guinean\nC. louisiadensis group, average sequence divergence among the species ranges from 10.90% (between C. epiroti-\ncus and C. louisiadensis) up to 17.44% (between C. louisiadensis and C. robustus) (Table 3).\n\f",
    "Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press \u00b7 17\nREVISION OF AUSTRALIAN CYRTODACTYLUS\nInterestingly, in the one instance in which two New Guinean species of the C. louisiadensis complex are\nknown to occur sympatrically (C. louisiadensis and C. klugei on Sudest Island), the two species are not sister taxa.\nSuch results are suggestive of multiple, independent colonisations of this island rather than in situ speciation from\na common ancestor.\nFinally, the tree clearly shows that the five Australian Cyrtodactylus lineages are not an extension of a geo-\ngraphic cline within an expanded C. louisiadensis.\nMorphology\nTesting the hypothesis of clinal variation within an expanded Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis. Within the Solomon\nIslands arc, the relationships of femoroprecloacal pores and enlarged femoroprecloacal scales against longitude\nwere not significant (pores: r2\n= 0.032; F1,15 = 0.500, P = 0.490; scales: r2\n= 0.061; F1,45 = 2.928, P = 0.094). Number\nof transventral scales was significantly related to longitude (r2\n= 0.405; F1,47 = 31.987, P < 0.001) with a general\ndecrease from north-west to south-east. However, the pattern of variation was not clinal, with the south-eastern-\nmost individuals reverting to relatively high counts (a pattern also seen in pore and femoroprecloacal scale counts,\nin which the lowest counts were at intermediate localities).\nWithin the New Guinea arc, the relationship of femoroprecloacal pores to longitude was not significant (r2\n=\n0.056; F1,31 = 1.856, P = 0.183), but significant relationships were present for femoroprecloacal scales (r2\n= 0.259;\nF1,82 = 28.664, P < 0.001) and transventral scales (r2\n= 0.463; F1,82 = 70.835, P < 0.001), with both increasing at the\nsouth-eastern end of the distribution, representing the Louisiade Archipelago. The pattern of variation was again\nnot evenly clinal, with an apparent clinal decrease from north-west to south-east along the New Guinea coastline,\nand inter-island variation in the Louisiade Archipelago.\nWithin the Australian arc, all three characters showed a significant negative correlation with latitude, so that\ncounts were lowest in the south-east (pores: r2\n= 0.774; F1,53 = 154.349, P < 0.001; femoroprecloacal scales: r2\n=\n0.517; F1,135 = 142.428, P < 0.001; transventral scales: r2\n= 0.245; F1,129 = 41.787, P < 0.001). However, in each case\n(Fig. 4), the distribution was categorical rather than clinal, with high counts in the north and low counts in the\nsouth, and for femoroprecloacal scales, two groups were evident in the north, one with high counts, and the other\nwith low counts. This reflects the two major genetic lineages of Australian species.\nVariation among the Australian populations. There are consistent differences in colour pattern and scalation\nbetween the five genetic lineages, and between the two major clusters of lineages (see Comparisons with other spe-\ncies, in each species account). However, we were unable to find morphological differences between the two genetic\nsubgroups in the Chillagoe lineage.\nMultivariate analyses. Both female and male analyses provided high levels of discrimination of the Austra-\nlian lineages.\nFemales (Fig. 5, Table 3). The first factor, which explained 75.6% of the total dispersion, provided complete\nseparation between the two major lineages identified in the genetic analysis, the Pascoe River\/McIlwraith group,\nand the Tozer's Gap, Cooktown and Chillagoe groups. The second factor, which explained 18.2% of the total dis-\npersion, separated the two southern lineages within the second major lineage, with the geographically distant\nTozer's Gap population being morphologically intermediate. The third factor, which explained 5.1% of the disper-\nsion largely separated the Tozer's Gap population from the two southern lineages. The fourth factor, explaining\n1.1% of the dispersion, provided separation of the Pascoe River from the McIlwraith group (scores -1.79 to +0.25\nvs +0.45 to +1.92). Overall, the multivariate analysis correctly identified almost all individuals (98.5%, n = 67).\nThe only misidentified individual was one from Pascoe River, which was identified as a McIlwraith animal,\nalthough it was still outside the range of McIlwraith individuals on Factor 4 scores.\nMales (Fig. 6, Table 3). The first factor, which explained 86.3% of the total dispersion, again provided com-\nplete separation beween the two major lineages. The second factor, explaining 10.0% of the dispersion, distin-\nguished the two southern lineages (Cooktown and Chillagoe), and partially separated the Pascoe River and\nMcIlwraith lineages, while the third factor, explaining 3.7% of the dispersion, provided further separation of the\nlatter two lineages. For all three factors, the single Tozer's Gap male (treated as unclassified) was closest to the\nCooktown\/Chillagoe lineages, but either intermediate between them, or slightly outside the values for either.

Previous hypotheses that the Australian populations are assignable to a New Guinea species, C. lou-\nisiadensis, or to a Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis species group defined on shared colour pattern and enlarged subcaudal\nscales, are rejected. Evidence is provided for the existence of five endemic species in Australia, allopatrically distributed.\nCyrtodactylus tuberculatus (Lucas & Frost) is formally resurrected for Australian populations in the Cooktown area, from\nMt Leswell north to Stanley Island. Four new species are described: C. mcdonaldi sp. nov. in the south, from the Chillagoe\narea north to Parrot Creek Falls, C. hoskini sp. nov. from the Iron Range area, C. adorus sp. nov. from the Pascoe River\ndrainage, and C. pronarus sp. nov. from the McIlwraith Range. Concordant genetic and morphological evidence enable\nthe hypothesis that C. adorus and C. pronarus represent a species pair distinct from the sublineage represented by C. tu-\nberculatus, C. mcdonaldi and C. hoskini.\nKey words: Reptilia, Gekkonidae, Cyrtodactylus, Cape York, Australia, new species\nIntroduction\nCyrtodactylus Gray, 1827, is the largest genus of gekkonid lizards. Like many other large genera, its speciose\nnature has hindered cladistic analysis of both intrageneric relationships and generic limits. A number of genera or\nsubgenera (Altigekko Khan 2003, Cyrtopodion Fitzinger 1843, Geckoella Gray 1867, Indogekko Khan 2003,\nMediodactylus Szczerbak & Golubev 1977, Nactus Kluge 1987, Siwaligekko Khan 2003, Tenuidactylus Szczerbak\n& Golubev 1984) have been proposed for species formerly treated as part of Cyrtodactylus, but there is ongoing\ndispute about the limits of many of these (see Krysko et al. 2007 for a partial review). Even with the removal of all\nspecies that could be considered part of these other taxa, Cyrtodactylus still includes 137 species. Well over half of\nthose species (78) have been described since 2000 (Fig. 1), and most descriptions are based on small samples (117\nof the 137 species have type series of fewer than ten specimens; 26 were described only from holotypes) from few\nlocalities (117 were described from one or two localities). There has been little change over time in the sampling\/\ndescriptive approach. When the data are divided into four quartiles (years 1827-72, 1873-1918, 1919-64, 1965-\n2011), there has been little or no change in the mode (1) and median number (1) of localities, or the modal number\nof specimens (1 for all quartiles except the third, with mode 2), and only a gradual increase in the median number\nof types (from 2 in each of the first two quartiles, to 3 in the third, and 5 in the most recent quartile). Small, geo-\ngraphically limited samples diminish the capacity to study morphological variation, both within and between popu-\nlations, and consequently, there has been a tendency either to assign new specimens or populations to existing\n\f",
    "Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press \u00b7 21\nREVISION OF AUSTRALIAN CYRTODACTYLUS\nDISCUSSION\nSystematics of the Australian Cyrtodactylus. The inconsistent patterns of morphological variation among Cyrto-\ndactylus louisiadensis sensu lato, together with the levels of genetic variation between the populations, are incom-\npatible with the hypothesis of a single wide-ranging species, as previously argued by Kraus (2008) on\nmorphological grounds alone for the New Guinea populations.\nThe five geographically discrete genetic lineages identified among the Australian populations are also distin-\nguishable morphologically, with both data sets showing the same pattern of clustering of lineages. While there is\nnot yet evidence of geographic overlap that would allow for assessment of species boundaries by direct application\nof the interbreeding criteria of the biological species concept, there are two instances where there is close geo-\ngraphic approach. The Chillagoe and Cooktown lineages approach to within 3 km, without evidence of either mor-\nphological intermediacy (Figs. 7, 8) or mixing of mitochondrial haplotypes, arguing for their recognition as\nseparate species, although both belong to the same major lineage. In the far north, the Tozer's Gap and Pascoe\nRiver lineages, which belong to different major lineages, approach to within 20 km, again without any morpholog-\nical intermediacy or haplotype mixing. As the degrees of genetic and morphological differentiation of the remain-\ning combinations of lineages are within the spectrum represented by these two species pairs, we treat all five\nAustralian lineages as discrete species.\nFIGURE 7. Latitudinal variation in function 2 scores for Cooktown and Chillagoe lineage females. Symbols as for Fig. 5.\nThe only two type specimens nominally from Australian localities are nested geographically within the Cook-\ntown lineage, and morphologically accord with that lineage. Hence, the Cooktown lineage should be known as\nCyrtodactylus tuberculatus. The remaining four lineages are treated as undescribed species, and named herein: C.\nadorus sp. nov. for the Pascoe River lineage, C. pronarus sp. nov. for the McIlwraith lineage, C. hoskini sp. nov.\nfor the Tozer's Gap lineage, and C. mcdonaldi sp. nov. for the Chillagoe lineage.\nWhile our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Australian Cyrtodactylus species are a monophyletic group,\nour genetic comparisons are insufficiently extensive in their sampling across other regional Cyrtodactylus species\nto provide categorical certainty.

bands, and the dark bands consist of a nuchal band, a band over the shoulders, and modally three bands over\nthe trunk, and hence differ from species having very narrow pale bands (aaroni, aurensis, badenensis, batik,\nderongo Brown & Parker 1973, eisenmanae, grismeri, mimikanus, redimiculus, wallacei and wayakonei), those\nhaving very narrow dark bands on an overall pale background (capreoloides, consobrinoides, gansi and wakeo-\nrum), those having an extra dark band between the nuchal band and the shoulder band (annandalei, bichnganae,\nchrysopylos and wakeorum), one species which lacks a dark shoulder band (badenensis), species having only two\ndark bands across the trunk (batik, caovansungi, deveti Brongersma 1948, hontreensis, irianjayaensis R\u00f6sler 2001,\nmurua, phongnhakebangensis Ziegler et al. 2002, sumonthai, tiomanensis Das & Lim 2000 and zugi Oliver et al.\n2008), and those having modally five dark bands across the trunk (aaroni, boreoclivus Oliver et al. 2011, chrysopy-\nlos, consobrinoides and halmahericus (Mertens 1929)).\nThe Australian species have a single row of transversely oriented broad median subcaudal scales, and hence\ndiffer from the following species, which have small subcaudal scales: adleri, agamensis, agusanensis, annulatus,\nayeyarwadyensis, batucolus, biordinis, brevidactylus, brevipalmatus, buchardi, capreoloides,

zhao-\nermii, ziegleri and zugi.\nLike most Cyrtodactylus species, the Australian species lack a precloacal groove, and hence differ from the\nfollowing species, which have either a longitudinal or transverse precloacal groove: agamensis, annulatus, auren-\nsis, cavernicolus, fumosus, gansi, halmahericus, jambangan, macrotuberculatus Grismer & Norhayati 2008, mar-\nmoratus, nuaaulu, papuensis, philippinicus, pubisulcus, pulchellus Gray 1827, rubidus, semenanjungensis,\nspinosus, stresemanni and tautbatorum.\nThe Australian species have between 24-45 longitudinal rows of ventral scales between the ventrolateral skin\nfolds at midbody, and differ from the following species, which have either fewer than 24 rows (aequalis, macrotu-\nberculatus and variegatus), or 45 or more rows

The change of status of Australian Cyrtodactylus from a single taxon conspecific\nwith a widespread New Guinean and Solomon Islands species, to five endemic Australian taxa with non-overlap-\nping distributions, has profound implications for the conservation status to be applied to each of these taxa.

Four years later, Waite (1905) noted the strong similarity of the\nbanded pattern of G. olivii with Gymnodactylus louisiadensis, described by de Vis (1892) from Tagula Island in the\nLouisiade Archipelago of New Guinea. Waite did not have access to the type specimen of either species but he did\ncommunicate with Olive (though probably Edmund A. C. Olive's son, Edmund Olive, likewise a naturalist) who\ndid not recognise the species amongst the Cooktown fauna he was familiar with. On this basis, together with\nWaite's identification of a further strongly banded Cyrtodactylus specimen from Guadalcanal Island in the Solo-\nmon Islands, which he identified as louisiadensis, Waite suggested that the type of olivii was not Australian but\ninstead came from New Guinea or the Solomon Islands.\nBarbour (1921) was the next to consider C. louisiadensis. In addition to Waite's Guadalcanal specimen, Bar-\nbour reported another specimen of louisiadensis from Malaita, thus further confirming the occurrence of the spe-\ncies in the Solomon Islands. Barbour accepted Waite's argument that G. olivii was based on a New Guinean\nspecimen but also mentions a specimen from Rockhampton that he referred to louisiadensis. Barbour's work was\nbased solely on the Malaita and Rockhampton specimens, together with the holotype of olivii. Kinghorn (1928)\nwas able to confirm the existence of banded Cyrtodactylus in the Cooktown area, reporting on a specimen sent by\nOlive to the Australian Museum subsequent to Waite's report. However, he did not examine the holotype, or the\nmaterial reported by Barbour (1921).\nThe implication from both Waite and Barbour that olivii was New Guinean led to it being treated as a synonym\nof louisiadensis by de Rooij (1915), Kinghorn (1928) and Loveridge (1934), although Zietz (1920), in an uncritical\nchecklist, continued to list olivii as a distinct species. Loveridge (1948) referred specimens from Gusiko in Papua\nNew Guinea and New Georgia in the Solomon Islands to louisiadensis, supporting the view that louisiadensis was\na Papuan\/Solomon species, but continuing to expand its distribution in the region. This view is understandable; at\nthe time of description of olivii, only three species of Cyrtodactylus had been described or reported from New\nGuinea and the Solomon Islands: novaeguineae Schlegel 18371\n, louisiadensis and loriae Boulenger 1898. Both\nlouisiadensis and olivii had similar strongly banded patterns that were very different to the vertebral blotching pres-\nent in novaeguineae and loriae. A further three species of Cyrtodactylus were described from New Guinea in the\n\f",

Relative lengths of digits on manus I<II<V<III<IV; on pes I<II<III=V<IV. Very\nslight traces of webbing between bases of fingers; weak webbing between bases of toes 2\u20133, 3\u20134 and 4\u20135.\nTail a little longer than body (TL\/SVL 120.4\u2013146.5%, mean = 127.9%, sd = 7.73, n = 11), narrow at base (TW\/\nSVL 5.7\u201310.6%, mean = 8.4%, sd = 1.07, n = 62) and tapering evenly to a conical tip. Tail segments externally\nidentifiable by straight scale junctions, segments about 5\u20137 scales long when counted to include tubercles. Cloacal\nsacs present in both sexes, larger in males, external orifices just posterior to vent, laterally.\nColour in preservative. Dorsal pale ground colour fawn. Head dorsum (Fig. 11A) coarsely mottled with mid\nto dark brown, bordered posterolaterally by a narrow pale band which may itself have a sharply delimited dark\nbrown anterior edge. Pale nape zone bordered posteriorly by a U-shaped dark chevron on nape, widest vertebrally,\nand extending anteriorly over temporal region to eye, then usually weakly present over posterior lores. Second\nbroad dark transverse dorsal band over shoulders, lateral margins extending more narrowly anteroventrally in front\nof forelimbs. Usually three (78.6%, n = 56), sometimes four (17.9%), rarely five (3.6%) dark bands over trunk,\nextending lateroventrally with even width, but dissipating over flanks. A dark band over hips. Tail with dark bands\nover most of length, but distal third of tail usually pale cream to white, with bands barely evident. When they can\nbe counted to the distal end of tail, dark tail bands 11\u201316 (mean = 13.5, sd = 1.83, n = 12). On nape and body, dark\nbands of nearly equal width to pale interspaces, and with abrupt straight edges; pigmentation generally darkest\nalong band margins, leaving centre of bands a little lighter. Bands on tail (Fig. 14A) of similar width to body bands,\nand equally spaced to pale interspaces, but darker and more solidly dark than those of body. Pale interspaces of\nbody often with a few dark brown spots.\nUpper and lower lips (Fig. 11F) mottled with mid-brown, mottling extending to postinfralabial area. Dorsum\nof forelimbs and hindlimbs similarly mid-brown mottled.\nEntire ventral surface immaculate, cream to pale yellow.\nAllometry. With respect to snout-vent length, AGL, TW, FLL and HLL are in positive allometry, while HL is\nin negative allometry; with respect to head length, HD, EYE, SL and IN are in negative allometry, while HW, EN,\nEE and EAR are in isometry (Table 4). Hence, small individuals will have proportionally shorter bodies and limbs,\nnarrower tails and longer and deeper heads, larger eyes, and longer and wider snouts than large individuals (Table\n5(i)).\nSexual dimorphism. Adult females have proportionally longer bodies (greater AGL\/SVL) but narrower tails\nand shorter limbs than adult males of the same size (Table 5(ii)). While there are statistically significant differences\nin the shape of the head in some measurements, they are not consistent at all sizes, with adult males having wider\nheads (HW\/HL), but longer snouts (SL\/HL, EN\/HL) and shorter postocular regions (EE\/HL) than similarly sized\nfemales at the onset of maturity, but the differences being reversed at larger sizes. The range of variation in these\nhead proportions extensively overlaps at all sizes, and the regression coefficients for the male values are generally\nlower than for the female data, which may be due to a paucity of small males resulting in a narrowing of the range\nof the independent variable, leading to less accuracy in the slope of the relationship. Consequently, these statistical\ndifferences may be artefactual.\nDescription of holotypes. The holotype of Hoplodactylus tuberculatus is an immature-sized female with SVL\n82 mm, AGL 34 mm, TL 107 mm, TW 8.7 mm, HL 23.4 mm, HW 20.5 mm, HD 11.2 mm, IN 3.5 mm, SL 10.5\nmm, EN 7.6 mm, EYE 5.7 mm, EE 8.0 mm, EAR 2.7 mm, FLL 12.7 mm, HLL 15.2 mm, lamellae below digits I-\nV 7+10, 10+12, 11+13, 12+12, 10+12 respectively, supralabials 10, infralabials 10, dorsal tubercle rows 24, trans-\nventral rows 31, enlarged femoroprecloacal scales 38, dark trunk bands 3, and dark tail bands ca. 11 (bands losing\ndistinction towards tip). The specimen is poorly preserved posteriorly, with some loss of the body wall along the\nposterior trunk and disarticulated vertebrae. Some of the skin of the head crown and throat has been torn across and\nbunched, possibly as a result of damage at the time of collection. Kluge (1963) described the specimen as \"moder-\nately well preserved\", although this may have been in comparison to the very poorly preserved, desiccated and dis-\narticulated holotypes of other gecko species reported in the same paper. While Lucas and Frost (1900) report the\nSVL as 88 mm, this measurement is only attainable if the specimen is abnormally stretched. The decomposition of\nthe posterior body cavity and concurrent loosening of the vertebrae in the region allow for this.\nThe holotype of Gymnodactylus olivii is an adult-sized female with SVL 105 mm, transventral scales 28, fem-\noroprecloacal scales 39, and dark trunk bands three. The specimen is well preserved.\n\f",

The\nholotype of H. tuberculatus lies close to the centre of the variation in Factor 2 scores for the Cooktown species\n(Fig. 5; score -1.62), and agrees in all coloration respects with the species. While we did not obtain a full set of\ncounts and measurements from the holotype of G. olivii, it also agrees closely with the Cooktown species,\nparticularly in the degree of tubercle development and the number of enlarged femoroprecloacal pores, which is\nmuch less than the range for any of the Papuan\/Solomon Islands species (all of which have 59 or more enlarged\nscales), and we see no reason to doubt the type locality, which is close to the centre of the distribution of the\nspecies. Hence, we reject the hypothesis of Waite (1905) that the holotype of G. olivii is not from Australia.\nEtymology. Not specifically stated by Lucas and Frost (1900), but presumably from the Latin tuberculatus (=\ntuberculate), and in allusion to the strongly developed dorsal tubercles of the species.\nDistribution. Found on mainland Australia, from Cape Melville, south to Mt Leswell (Fig. 15). Also present\non Stanley Island, in the Flinders Islands, just north of Cape Melville.\nFIGURE 15.

The flat area just north of the Bloomfield River mouth is now Wyalla Plains,\ncrossed by Hislop's Creek. Hislop's property was on the track north of the Bloomfield River to the Mt Romeo tin-\nfields, and he was well-known to the workers at the tin-fields (Anon 1887). Hence, the track referred to is presum-\nably the Grass Tree Pocket Road, which passes through Stuckey's Gap. The track from Wyalla to Mt Romeo passed\nnear Mt McMillan, which Hislop was known to have visited (Anon 1887), and he would have obtained his supplies\nand shipped his collection from Cooktown. Hence, it is possible that he obtained the specimens from north of his\nproperty. We regard the \"Bloomfield River\" locality as an approximation only, and have provided coordinates for\nthe Wyalla Plains rather than the current settlement at Bloomfield River.\nIn addition to the distribution based on examined specimens, Hoskin and Higgie (2008) report \"Cyrtodactylus\nlouisiadensis\" from Jowalbinna Station, south-west of Laura, about 110 km west of the southern end of the distri-\nbution of C. tuberculatus. We have examined photographs, and tentatively identify the species at that locality as C.\ntuberculatus.\nThe Rockhampton locality reported by Barbour (1921) is well outside the known distribution of Australian\nCyrtodactylus. The specimen is a typical C. tuberculatus, and the locality is here considered erroneous. Even fur-\nther distant is the nominal locality for AM R16905, Point Lookout, NSW. This specimen is identified in the regis-\ntration entry as Phyllurus cornutus (Ogilby 1892) (material of that nominal species from that locality is now\nSaltuarius moritzi Couper et al. 2008), and given this identification, it is assumed that the tag has subsequently\nbecome associated with the wrong specimen.\nConservation status. Using the IUCN criteria, this species most closely fits the Least Concern category (LC),\nin that it has a relatively large distribution with little evidence of continuing declines or fluctuations and with exten-\nsive parts of its distribution in protected areas.\nComments. Although Wells (2002) stated that C. tuberculatus can attain a maximum body length of around\n160 mm, we have found no evidence of such extreme sizes among the material available to us of this species in the\nsense used by Wells (populations between the Atherton Tableland and the Cooktown area), or indeed in any Aus-\ntralian Cyrtodactylus population. Given that our samples are sexually mature by 91 mm for females (QM J60620)\nand 97 mm for males (QM J54127, J87034), and the next smallest individuals (QM J24493, 82 mm; AM R57123,\n79 mm, both females) are immature and not approaching maturity, we estimate maturity is reached at about 90 mm.\nA hypothetical maximum SVL of 160 mm would provide a ratio of maximum\/minimum mature sizes of 1.78,\nbeyond that known for other gekkonines (1.26\u20131.30 for males, 1.13\u20131.21 for females for two Cyrtodactylus spe-\ncies; Fitch 1981; 1.03\u20131.44 for males of nine other gekkonine species and 1.01\u20131.29 for females of eleven other\ngekkonines; Doughty 1996; Doughty & Thompson 1998; Fitch 1981, excluding the South American species of\nPhyllodactylus Gray 1828 listed by Fitch from the data of Dixon and Huey 1970, which included subadults in the\nrange). Using the maximum sizes in our material, the ratios were 1.29 (males) and 1.33 (females) for C. tubercula-\ntus.\nSpecimens examined.

Cyrtodactylus tuberculatus differs from C. klugei and C. robustus in having\nmany fewer femoroprecloacal pores (34\u201344 vs 66 or more; Kraus 2008) in males. The difference in number of\npores is mirrored by the number of scales bearing them, which are countable in both males and females (34\u201346 vs\n69\u201392), and by the number of transventral scales (24\u201337 vs 41\u201354; counts from this study, which differ slightly\nfrom those provided by Kraus 2008, possibly reflecting different reference points). Cyrtodactylus tuberculatus is\nmuch more strongly tuberculate than C. klugei. It is further distinguished from C. klugei in having three or more\ndark bands across the trunk (vs usually two), head dorsum marbled (vs immaculate), and in usually possessing dark\nmacules in the pale interspaces between bands (vs always lacking). It is further differentiated from C. robustus,\nwith which it shares very prominent tubercles, in its lesser size (SVL to 119 mm vs 161 mm; Kraus 2008), presence\nof a dark band across the hips (vs usually lacking), and marbled lips (vs pale lips). It also lacks the bright orange\ncloaca of C. robustus.\nFor comparison with other Australian Cyrtodactylus, see the descriptions of those species.\nNatural history. This species has been collected from the granite boulder fields at Cape Melville (Keith\nMcDonald, pers. comm.). It is found on sandstone at Isabella Falls and Bridge Creek (near Cooktown) and shelter-\ning in the extensive aerial root systems of mature fig trees (Ficus virens) in riverine rainforest along the banks of\nthe Endeavour River. It will also colonise buildings in the Endeavour Valley that are in close association with suit-\nable habitat. At Finch Bay (Cooktown) it was found amongst large granite boulders on the beach front that were\nbacked by open eucalypt forest with rainforest emergents. At Black Mountain (Fig. 16A), it is generally associated\nwith the vegetation on the basal slopes (Ficus virens, Ficus obliqua, eucalypts and umbrella trees) but a juvenile\nwas found at night well up on the boulder field. At this locality, it can also be seen during the day sheltering in the\ncavities beneath granite boulders near the base of the mountain. Specimens collected at Mt Leswell came from\ngranite boulders and vegetation along a drainage line.\nObservations on feeding by this species, together with stomach content records are provided by Covacevich et\nal.

Loreal region moderately inflated, canthus rostralis poorly defined. Interorbital region and top\nof snout concave, deepest and widest just anterior to level of rostral canthus of eye. Snout moderately long (SL\/HL\n28.4\u201341.0%, mean = 37.2%, sd = 2.19, n = 25; only one individual less than 35.1%); EN\/HL 25.2\u201330.0%, mean =\n27.6%, sd = 0.98, n = 25), much longer than eye diameter (SL\/EYE 118.3\u2013193.0%, mean = 167.8%, sd = 15.99, n\n= 25, only one less than 143.6%), and a little longer than eye-ear interval (EE\/HL 27.6\u201333.1%, mean = 29.9%, sd =\n1.42, n = 25). Eye large (EYE\/HL 19.2\u201327.0%, mean = 22.3%, sd = 2.03, n = 25), pupil vertical with crenated mar-\ngin, forming about 3\u20134 low lobes along each edge of pupil. Supraciliaries in a double row, large, frill-like, well-dif-\nferentiated from adjacent more medial granules of the brow ridge, and largest anteriorly. Ear opening small (EAR\/\nHL 6.7\u201312.3%, mean = 8.8%, sd = 1.21, n = 25), usually a little taller than long and slightly angled posterodorsally,\nbut sometimes rounder. Rostral wider than high, height at centre less than that more laterally, dorsal part usually\ndivided by a relatively straight median groove (groove with small side branch in QM J87078, 'T'-shaped in QM\nJ87072, terminates as a small isolated scale within the rostral shield in QM J60726 and replaced by a small scale\ndeeply penetrating the upper medial edge of the rostral in QM J87047) that extends approximately \u00bd the midline\nheight of the scale, and fails to reach the oral margin. Usually two enlarged supranasals separated by usually a sin-\ngle, less enlarged internasal (supranasals in contact in QM J87076 and QM J87084, and two internasals present in\nQM J87048). External nares circular, bordered by first supralabial, rostral, supranasal, nasal (extending into poste-\nrior part of nostril) and 1\u20133 smaller granular scales between nasal and first supralabial. Nares moderately separated\n(IN\/HL 10.9\u201315.6%, mean = 12.5%, sd = 0.91, n = 25). Supralabials anteriorly large, distinct from adjacent loreal\ngranules, 8\u201310 (mode = 8 (48.0%), mean = 8.7, sd = 0.75, n = 25) to level of mid-orbit, then inflecting dorsally and\nposteriorly, and becoming smaller, to gradually blend along rictal margin with adjacent small granules; supralabials\nseparated from orbital margin by at least two rows of small granular scales at narrowest point. Mental wider than\ndeep, with a strong median extension, a little to moderately narrower (50% of specimens) or equal to rostral, and\nbordered posteriorly by a single elongate pair of large postmentals (Fig. 10B). Infralabials anteriorly much larger\nthan adjacent gular scales, becoming smaller posteriorly, 8\u201312 (mode = 10 (44.0%), mean = 9.8, sd = 0.82, n = 25).\nFirst infralabial with \u2154\u2013\u00be of ventral border contacting postmental, \u00bc \u2013\u2153 by anteriormost enlarged subinfralabial\n(fully contacting postmental in QM J87072 and QM J87084). Subinfralabial scales anteriorly large, flattened, and\npolygonal, becoming smaller, more rounded and granular posteriorly and medially (towards gular area).\nBody moderately robust (AGL\/SVL 33.5\u201347.1%, mean = 42.2%, sd = 2.82, n = 25), with low, but distinct,\nventrolateral skin folds approximately marking the transition between the enlarged flattened ventral scalation and\nthe smaller, more rounded, granular lateral scalation. Scales on dorsum of head, body and limbs small, juxtaposed,\nrounded granules, with interspersed much larger tubercles. Granular scales finest over parietal region of head,\nbecoming coarser over body, then more polygonal and flatter on tail. On head dorsum, tubercles small and only\nslightly projecting, anteriorly commencing in the posterior interocular area, becoming larger, more projecting and\nwith a more conical, slightly posteriorly-tilted apex over nape (Fig. 11B). Tubercles on body dorsum larger again\n(Fig. 12B), but with a more longitudinally ovoid base, often with a weak median keel, and relatively low on ante-\nrior body, but becoming much more projecting posteriorly on body, over sacrum and onto tail base, where they are\nmarkedly conical. Tubercles persist along tail, one to two whorls per segment, becoming lower and less differenti-\nated until eventually losing their distinction by about the fifth dark band. Large tubercles on body dorsum separated\nby 2-4 smaller granular scales, those on head and nape more widely separated by several scales. Tubercles on body\narranged in about 18\u201323 (mean = 20.5, sd = 1.36, n = 25) roughly longitudinal rows. Dorsum of brachium rela-\ntively homogenous, sub-imbricate to imbricate; antebrachium with more imbricate, larger scales distally and over\nmanus, and with dispersed, larger tubercles (Fig. 13B). Dorsum of thigh and crus with small, juxtaposed granules\nand densely packed, large tubercles, only dorsum of pes with imbricate scales (Fig. 13G).\n\f",

Named after Keith R. McDonald (b: 1950), Principal Senior Technical Officer, Threatened Spe-\ncies Unit, Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management, and an Honorary Research Associ-\nate of the Queensland Museum, resident of Atherton, and discoverer of numerous north Queensland reptile and\namphibian species. It was Keith who first alerted PC that Australian 'C. louisiadensis' had an interesting, frag-\nmented distribution and warranted further investigation. Keith was instrumental in collecting many of the initial tis-\nsue samples on which this revision is based.\nDistribution. From Parrot Creek Falls, near Shiptons Flat, in the north, south to Chillagoe and 21.4 km E Chil-\nlagoe (Fig. 15).\nConservation status. Using the IUCN criteria, this species most closely fits the Least Concern category (LC),\nin that it has relatively large distribution with little evidence of continuing declines or fluctuations and with exten-\nsive parts of its distribution in protected areas.\nComparison with other species (Table 6). Cyrtodactylus mcdonaldi is geographically proximate to C. tuber-\nculatus with the two closest localities for each species (Mt Leswell C. tuberculatus and Parrot Creek Falls C.\nmcdonaldi) being separated by only 3 km. Cyrtodactylus mcdonaldi is also a sister taxon of C. tuberculatus with an\naverage sequence divergence of 11.07% (Table 2). It may be differentiated morphologically from C. tuberculatus\nby males having the distal femoral pores separated from the proximal femoroprecloacal pores by 4\u20139 unpored\nscales. It is further differentiated from C. tuberculatus by its smaller size (SVL males 69.5\u2013100 vs 96\u2013116.5 mm;\nfemales 88.5\u2013105 vs 46\u2013119 mm), less tuberculate skin (most obvious in the postlabial area, which is smooth vs\nusually tuberculate in C. tuberculatus, and on the antebrachium, which has protruding tubercles only on the largest\nindividuals, but flat tubercles often present vs strongly projecting tubercles in all adult C. tuberculatus). The colour\npattern is generally 'cleaner' than in C. tuberculatus, with the crown of the head only with grey smudges (vs usually\nstrongly mottled), the labial areas less strongly mottled, the postlabial area usually immaculately pale (vs mottled),\nthe pale interspaces between dark body bands lacking dark macules (vs usually with some dark spots), and the ante-\nbrachium nearly plain (vs usually more mottled). The dark body bands usually have only a prominently dark poste-\nrior margin (both prominent dark anterior and posterior edges in C. tuberculatus). A dark band over the hips is\noften lacking in C. mcdonaldi, but consistently present in C. tuberculatus.\nCyrtodactylus mcdonaldi differs from C. klugei and C. robustus in having many fewer femoroprecloacal pores\n(29\u201335 vs 66 or more; Kraus 2008) in males. The difference in number of pores is mirrored by the number of\nenlarged scales bearing them, which are countable in both males and females (37\u201345 vs 66 or more), and by the\nnumber of transventral scales (28\u201341 vs 41\u201354). It differs from both in having the femoroprecloacal pores broken\ninto three series. Cyrtodactylus mcdonaldi is much more strongly tuberculate than C. klugei. It is further distin-\nguished from C. klugei in having three dark bands across the trunk (vs usually two). It is further differentiated from\nC. robustus, with which it shares prominent tubercles, in its lesser size (SVL to 105 mm vs 161 mm; Kraus 2008),\npresence of a dark band across the hips (vs usually lacking), and marbled lips (vs pale lips). It also lacks the bright\norange cloaca of C. robustus.\nFor comparisons with C. hoskini, C. adorus and C. pronarus, see the descriptions of those species.\nNatural history. At Chillagoe, this species is found around limestone karsts, associated with poorly developed\nvine thickets, in open savannah woodland (Fig. 16B). A specimen from the Mareeba area was collected from an\nisolated granite outcrop, in granite hill country adjacent to a drainage line, in open forest with a grassy understory.\nSpecimens from Mt Windsor National Park came from a road cutting in granite hills, surrounded by eucalypt-dom-\ninated woodland. The Parrot Creek (Shiptons Flat) site is comprised of exposed granite along a drainage line in wet\nsclerophyll forest. Genetic samples from Mt Poverty were collected from animals living on granitic outcrops in tall\neucalypt forest (Keith McDonald, pers. comm.). Cyrtodactylus (not sampled but presumably C. mcdonaldi) have\nbeen found in the Bloomfield area on trees in open woodland, where few rock outcrops occur (Lewis Roberts, pers.\nobs.). They are also known to colonise houses in this area and at Shiptons Flat (Lewis Roberts, pers. obs.).\n\f",

    "Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press \u00b7 5\nREVISION OF AUSTRALIAN CYRTODACTYLUS\nyears between 1901 and 1950: mimikanus Boulenger 1914, sermowaiensis de Rooij 1915 and papuensis Brong-\nersma 1934 (originally described as novaeguineae, with Brongersma 1928 failing to notice the homonymy). None\nof these had broad alternating pale and dark bands.\nNone of the aforementioned authors had noticed the existence of a slightly earlier record of Cyrtodactylus in\nAustralia. Lucas and Frost (1900) described Hoplodactylus tuberculatus from a single specimen from the Endeav-\nour River, on which Cooktown is located. This species was largely overlooked in subsequent studies, or continued\nto be listed in its original combination (Zietz 1920; Lucas & le Souef 1909). It was more than 60 years later that\nKluge (1963) noted its true generic identity and synonymised the species with C. louisiadensis. Based on his exam-\nination of the holotype of tuberculatus and other (unspecified) Australian specimens, Kluge also viewed the\nbanded Cyrtodactylus as a single species, C. louisiadensis. He noted slight morphological differences (unspecified)\nbetween the Queensland and New Guinean populations and suggested a \"moderately long period of isolation from\nthe parental stock\".\nLucas and Frost's assignment of tuberculatus to a genus otherwise restricted to New Zealand is not as biogeo-\ngraphically anomalous as it appears. At the time of their work, they had recently completed a summary of the New\nZealand herpetofauna (Lucas & Frost 1897), and two species of Hoplodactylus Fitzinger 1843 were considered to\noccur in India. Hence, their recognition of a species from Australia was seen as bridging the gap between these two\ndisparate localities. However, one of the two \"Indian\" Hoplodactylus, H. duvaucelii (Dum\u00e9ril & Bibron 1836) was\nlater shown (Smith 1933a) to be a New Zealand species with an incorrect type locality. The other, H. anamallensis\n(G\u00fcnther 1875) was referred to a new genus, Dravidogekko by Smith (1933b), which has since been subsumed\nwithin the genus Hemidactylus Gray 1825 (Bauer & Russell 1995).\nUntil recent times, C. louisiadensis has been treated as a species common to Cape York (Australia), New\nGuinea and the Solomon Islands (Brown & Parker 1973; Cogger et al. 1983). However, Brown and Parker (1973)\nreported an extraordinarily wide range of enlarged pore-bearing scales in the precloacofemoral region (38-80), not-\ning that \"this wide range may reflect population differences, since in our small sample those with the lowest num-\nber of pores were from Australia and those with the largest number from the Solomon Islands\". Again, Brown and\nParker did not identify the specimens they examined to reach this conclusion, other than to note that they had seen\nfew specimens (\"several males\"). Unfortunately, the number of pore-bearing scales is not useful in assigning the\nholotypes of G. olivii and H. tuberculatus to specific populations, as both specimens lack pores and are presumably\nfemales (Loveridge 1934; Kluge 1963). Brown and McCoy (1980) considered a new species from Guadalcanal, C.\nbiordinis, as part of the \"C. louisiadensis group\" though they did not define that group, other than to include C.\nnovaeguineae and C. loriae in it. They also provided additional quantification of the variation within a small sam-\nple of C. louisiadensis (two from the Louisiade Archipelago, four from New Guinea, and 16 from the Solomon\nIslands) but without any indication of localities within these regions or listing of the specimens examined. They\nprovided no data on pore numbers for the former two regions, suggesting that all those specimens were female.\nIt was not until 1984 that there was a challenge to a monophyletic or monotypic C. louisiadensis. Wells and\nWellington (1984, 1985) resurrected C. tuberculatus as a distinct Australian species but failed to provide any diag-\nnostic characters, and assigned it to a new genus, Quantasia. Only C. tuberculatus was formally included in Quan-\ntasia, which they considered to be restricted to \"Cape York Peninsula\" (Wells & Wellington 1984). Their generic\ndiagnosis has no description but includes the statement that the genus was distributed in \"north eastern Australia,\nNew Guinea and associated islands\". Of the morphological characters purported to differentiate the genus, most are\nwidespread in Cyrtodactylus, and hence it is not possible to determine the full extent of their genus, although it pre-\nsumably included C. louisiadensis, which was restricted to the type locality, hence leaving other populations in\nNew Guinea and the Solomon Islands innominate. Subsequent authors have failed to recognise Quantasia,\nalthough some (Bauer 2002, 2003; Batuwita & Bahir 2005; R\u00f6sler et al. 2007; R\u00f6sler & Glaw 2008; Hayden et al.\n2008) have treated C. tuberculatus as distinct, without providing diagnostic characters. Wells (2002) noted that\nQuantasia was intended to encompass the Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis group, but did not define the content of that\ngroup, and returned Quantasia to the synonymy of Cyrtodactylus. In the same paper, he provided a redescription of\nCyrtodactylus tuberculatus, restricting it to the area between the Atherton Tablelands and Cooktown, and described\n1. Most authors (e.g., Brongersma 1934; Wermuth 1965; Bauer & Henle 1994) have given the year 1844 for Schlegel's description,\nbased on the last date in the range given on the cover page of Schlegel's monograph. However, Stejneger (1907) provides\nevidence that the first 20 pages of text and the first two plates, which include Schlegel's account for Cyrtodactylus, were\npublished in 1837 as the first part of the monograph.\n\f",

Hoskin, pers. comm.), and from the William Thompson Range (at the point\nwhere Fall Creek drops out of the William Thompson Range, just west of the Pascoe River Crossing, 12\u00ba 55' 27\" S\n143\u00ba 01' 30\" E; K. Aland, pers. comm.), about 29 km to the south-west (Fig. 20B).\nConservation status. This species has a very small known distribution that is unlikely to be much more exten-\nsive. We have no clear understanding of population size but expect it to be small, given the very small area of occu-\npancy and the low genetic diversity of this species on current sampling. The large adult size and colourful pattern\nof this species, together with its ready collection from accessible rock outcrops, could lead to it being targeted by\nillegal collection from the wild for the pet trade. These factors fulfil the IUCN criteria for a Vulnerable listing (cri-\nteria D1, VU D2).\nComparison with other species (Table 6). Cyrtodactylus hoskini is genetically most similar to C. tubercula-\ntus and C. mcdonaldi, differing from them by average sequence divergences of 12.12% and 11.79% respectively\n(Table 2). In comparison to C. tuberculatus, C. hoskini has more numerous transverse ventral scales (38\u201344 vs\n24\u201337) and precloacal scales (41\u201348, mean = 44.5 vs 34\u201346, mean = 39.8), a narrower, flatter head (HW\/HL\n62.7\u201369.8% vs 66.5\u201388.0%; HD\/HL 34.0\u201337.1% vs 35.3-57.5%), with a less well-developed postocular region\n(EN\/HL 23.6\u201327.8% vs 25.8\u201336.9%), and is generally less tuberculate than C. tuberculatus, with the postlabial\narea barely tuberculate (vs strongly tuberculate), the crus with only small, low tubercles (vs strongly tuberculate),\nand caudal tubercles absent by or at the second pale band (vs continuing to the third or fourth pale band or more,\ndistally). In coloration, C. hoskini has a generally less strongly mottled head dorsum (vs usually strongly mottled),\nstrong anterior extensions of dark body bands along the vertebral line (barely present in a few individuals of C.\ntuberculatus, but usually absent), and a dark bar in the pale interspaces ventrolaterally (absent in C. tuberculatus, or\nrepresented by scattered rounded spots).\nCyrtodactylus hoskini has more numerous transverse ventral scales than C. mcdonaldi (38\u201344 vs 28\u201341), more\nnumerous enlarged femoroprecloacal scales (41\u201348 vs 37\u201345), a longer tail (TL\/SVL 133.0\u2013147.7% vs\n117.0\u2013128.7%), a narrower and flatter head (HW\/HL 62.7\u201369.8% vs 65.0\u201378.9%; HD\/HL 34.0\u201337.1% vs\n35.8\u201343.4%), with a less well-developed temporal region (EE\/HL 23.6-27.8% vs 27.6-33.1%), and slightly longer\n\f",

The subdigital lamellae counts are at the upper end of the range\nfor C. mcdonaldi. The femoroprecloacal pores are in a single unbroken row (vs broken into three segments by\nunpored scales). The dark bands on body and nape have a strong anterior extension along the vertebral line (vs\nabsent), the pale interspaces have a dark bar ventrolaterally (vs usually no dark markings), and the dark dorsal\nbands have strong anterior and posterior edges (usually only a pronounced dark posterior edge in C. mcdonaldi).\nFIGURE 21. Distribution of Cyrtodactylus hoskini (diamonds), C. adorus (circles) and C. pronarus (squares). Open symbols\nindicate photographic record only.\nCyrtodactylus hoskini differs from C. klugei and C. robustus in having many fewer femoroprecloacal pores (48\nvs 66 or more) in males. The difference in number of pores is mirrored by the number of scales bearing them,\nwhich are countable in both males and females (41\u201348 (C. hoskini) vs 66 or more). In comparison to C. klugei, C.\nhoskini has three dark bands across the trunk (vs usually two), and has vertebral extensions of the dark body bands\n(vs absent). It is less strongly tuberculate than C. robustus, is smaller (SVL to 105 mm vs 161 mm) and has a nar-\nrower head (HW\/HL 62.7\u201369.8% vs 69\u201384%; Kraus 2008), and further differs from it in the presence of a dark\nband across the hips (vs usually lacking). It also lacks the bright orange cloaca of C. robustus.\nFor comparisons with C. adorus and C. pronarus, see the descriptions of those species.\nComments. The discovery of a Cyrtodactylus species at Iron Range, the stated type locality for Cyrtodactylus\nabrae Wells, 2002, requires revisiting the status of that nominal taxon. Couper et al. (2004) recommended treating\n\f",
    "SHEA ET AL.\n46 \u00b7 Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press\nthe name as unavailable, due to the lack of a type specimen in the original description. However, if a neotype were\nto be designated, the name could be validated. The limited description of C. abrae, which appears to be based on\nprevious accounts of a \"rainforest\" form of Cape York Cyrtodactylus presented by Wilson and Knowles (1988), in\nturn seemingly based on the published photograph by Cogger (1975), clearly does not represent the taxon we have\ndescribed from Iron Range. Wells (2002) defined C. abrae as being differentiated from C. tuberculatus by its pos-\nsession of fewer dark body bands (four, corresponding to two in our definition), and tail bands (seven). Cyrtodacty-\nlus hoskini, the only Cyrtodactylus that we have evidence of at Iron Range, has the same number of dark body\nbands (three) as C. tuberculatus, and none of the Australian Cyrtodactylus species have as few as seven dark tail\nbands or two dark body bands between axilla and groin. Wells (2002) also noted that C. abrae can attain a SVL of\n160 mm, considerably larger than any other Australian Cyrtodactylus. Hence, the possibility exists that the descrip-\ntion of C. abrae is based on a non-Australian taxon with incorrect type locality, and on current knowledge, it is not\npossible to nominate a neotype that is both from a locality close to the nominal type locality as well as according\nwith the nominal diagnosis of the taxon. Because of the considerable risk to destabilization of nomenclature by\nhaving this name potentially become a senior synonym of any one of the numerous Cyrtodactylus species\ndescribed since 2002 through nomination of a neotype, and the lack of sufficient detail in the description (or in the\nphotograph provided by Cogger (1975) that seems to have been the basis for that description) to clearly assign it to\nany one of the numerous banded Cyrtodactylus species, we choose to stabilize nomenclature by nominating as neo-\ntype of Cyrtodactylus abrae the larger syntype of Cyrtodactylus pulchellus, Natural History Museum, London\n(BMNH) xxii.91a, from Singapore. This action accords with the sparse detail that is available in the morphological\nand coloration description of C. abrae by Wells (2002), and relegates the name to synonymy. As we have demon-\nstrated, it is not possible to nominate a neotype that is as close as possible to the nominal type locality of C. abrae,\nconsistent with Article 75.3.6 of the Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999), because none of the Austra-\nlian Cyrtodactylus are morphologically consistent with the description of C. abrae. To comply with Article 75.3.3\nand 75.3.5, relevant to validation of neotype designations, we illustrate this specimen (the larger syntype of C. pul-\nchellus) in dorsal view (Fig. 22).\nNatural history. The type series of C. hoskini was collected amongst large granite boulders in predominantly\nopen forest interspersed with patches of rainforest (Fig. 23A). The nearby Garraway Creek site is immediately\nadjacent to the type locality for the microhylid frog Cophixalus kulakula, which is described and illustrated by\nHoskin and Aland (2011) as a boulder field, with festooning ferns vines and umbrella trees. The William Thomp-\nson Range population inhabits granite boulders in outcrops and along creek and gully lines in savannah woodland\nthat shows evidence of regular burns (K. Aland, pers. comm.).\nFIGURE 22. Neotype of Cyrtodactylus abrae \u2014 the larger syntype of Cyrtodactylus pulchellus (Natural History Museum\nLondon xxii.91a) (Photo: C. McCarthy).\n\f",

However, the redescription of C. tuberculatus was presented\nwithout any indication of the author having examined specimens, and gave little detail beyond that already pub-\nlished in general herpetology texts for the genus or the species C. louisiadensis. Wells did not specifically cite any\nsources for his descriptive data, and still did not provide any diagnosis that attempted to explicitly differentiate C.\ntuberculatus from the New Guinean and Solomon Islands populations of C. louisiadensis. Further, as noted by\nCouper et al. (2004), the description of C. abrae did not meet the requirements of the Code of Zoological Nomen-\nclature as the nominal holotype (\"the largest specimen from the type locality [Iron Range] in the Queensland\nMuseum collection\") did not exist. At the time of description, there was no indication in any museum collection of\na Cyrtodactylus population from Iron Range, although the Queensland Museum collection did house specimens\nfrom other north Queensland localities (Covacevich & Couper 1991). Despite this, a few authors continued to treat\nC. abrae as a distinct species (Batuwita & Bahir 2005; Hayden et al. 2008).\nThe first explicit hypothesis of relationships was proposed by Kraus and Allison (2006) when they described\nCyrtodactylus murua (specimens of which had earlier been referred to C. louisiadensis by Boulenger 1895) from\nWoodlark Island. These authors considered that the enlarged subcaudal scales of C. murua and C. louisiadensis,\nalthough apparently convergent with enlarged subcaudal scales in other more geographically distant Cyrtodactylus,\ndefined them as \"a small clade of taxa related to C. louisiadensis that inhabits the eastern Papuan-Solomon Island-\nAustralian region\".\nR\u00f6sler et al. (2007) more explicitly used the putative synapomorphy of enlarged subcaudal scales to define a\nC. louisiadensis species group, consisting of C. louisiadensis, C. murua, C. tuberculatus and the newly described\nC. salomonensis, from Ysabel Island, but excluding C. biordinis. While the same feature was present in C. mimi-\nkanus and C. aaroni G\u00fcnther & R\u00f6sler 2003 from western New Guinea, those species were excluded from the C.\nlouisiadensis group by possession of a larger number of body bands. Hence, the Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis group\nof R\u00f6sler et al. (2007), Kraus and Allison (2006), and presumably Quantasia, differs from that of Brown and\nMcCoy (1980).\nCyrtodactylus tuberculatus was treated as a distinct species by R\u00f6sler et al. (2007) who redescribed it from\nthree specimens (none of them the types of tuberculatus or olivii): two females from Cooktown, and one male from\n'Australia'. Their comparative material comprised seven specimens from Misima Island that they referred to C. lou-\nisiadensis, the two types of C. salomonensis from a single locality on Santa Isabel Island in the Solomons, and five\nadditional specimens that they tentatively considered close to C. salomonensis, three of which came from unknown\nlocalities in the Solomons, one from Bougainville Island, and one from an unknown locality in New Guinea. On\nthe basis of this limited sampling, they distinguished the Australian species from other New Guinean and Solo-\nmons populations previously ascribed to C. louisiadensis by the absence of enlarged tubercles along the lateral skin\nfold of the trunk. Further, they reported that C. tuberculatus had femoral and preanal pore clusters that were sepa-\nrated by several scales lacking pores (an observation based on the single male from an unknown locality). The three\nspecimens examined by these authors had a snout-vent length (SVL) range of 80\u201389 mm (the type of tuberculatus\nsimilarly had a reported SVL of 88 mm; Lucas & Frost 1900). This measurement falls well short of the 160 mm\nSVL reported by Wells (2002) for Australian Cyrtodactylus populations.\nMore recently, Kraus (2008) examined variation in New Guinean populations of banded Cyrtodactylus, and\ndivided these populations into five species, C. epiroticus (representing populations on the mainland of New\nGuinea, and possibly Normanby Island), C. klugei and C. lousiadensis (both restricted to Sudest Island), C. robus-\ntus (from Rossel Island) and C. tripartitus (from Misima Island). Hence, the Misima Island sample that was the\nbasis of R\u00f6sler et al.'s concept of C. louisiadensis did not represent that species. Kraus did not directly examine\nAustralian specimens, relying on the data of R\u00f6sler et al. (2007) for C. tuberculatus. He did not resolve the status of\nthe banded Cyrtodactylus of Bougainville Island and other islands in the Solomon group, and did not directly\naddress the hypothesis of Brown and Parker (1973) that C. louisiadensis was a single clinally varying species.\nAlthough his recognition of five species among the New Guinea populations could be argued to have indirectly\nrefuted this hypothesis, four of the species represent only single small islands, and he did not specifically explore\nvariation among the only wide-ranging taxon, C. epiroticus. However, this first extensive sampling of banded Cyr-\ntodactylus revealed that these populations did not occur along the south coast of New Guinea. Hence, the concept\nof a wide-ranging species from the Solomon Islands to Australia required a novel biogeographic pattern amongst\nAustralo-papuan reptiles of an Australian species or population being related to taxa from northern New Guinea\nand the Solomons, but not southern New Guinea.\n\f",

Generally with diffuse\nbrown mottling on gular region and abdomen. Ventral surface of tail dark with some pale band edges visible.\nDescription of holotype. The holotype of C. adorus is a mature-sized male, with the following character states\nof those variable for the taxon: SVL 104.5 mm, AGL 42.5 mm, TL 141.5 mm, TW 8.7 mm, HL 30.2 mm, HW 22.2\nmm, HD 11.6 mm, IN 4.0 mm, SL 12.0 mm, EN 8.9 mm, EYE 7.2 mm, EE 8.4 mm, EAR 2.5 mm, FLL 16.4 mm,\nHLL 21.8 mm, lamellae below digits I\u2013V 9+10, 11+11, 12+12, 12+13, 9+12 respectively, supralabials 9, infralabi-\nals 10, rows of dorsal tubercles 21, transventral rows 38, femoroprecloacal scales 63 and dark tail bands 11.\nEtymology. From the Greek \u03ac\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (adoros; = pure, incorruptible), alluding to the evenly and straight banded\ncoloration, unmarred by dark spotting, curves or irregular margins.\nDistribution. Known only from rocky outcrops on or near the lower reaches of the Pascoe River (Fig. 21).\nWattle Hills is about 12 km upstream from the type locality near the river mouth, while the Stanley Hill site is about\n2.5 km north of the type locality. The known sites are among the few rock outcrops in the area.\nConservation status. This species has a very small known distribution that is unlikely to be much more exten-\nsive and is probably also very fragmented. We have no clear understanding of population size but expect it to be\nsmall, given the very small area of occupancy and the low genetic diversity of this species on current sampling. The\nlarge adult size and colourful pattern of this species, together with its ready collection from accessible rock out-\ncrops, could lead to it being targeted by illegal collection from the wild for the pet trade. These factors fulfil the\nIUCN criteria for a Vulnerable listing (criteria D1, VU D2).\nComparison with other species (Table 6). Cyrtodactylus adorus genetically differs from C. tuberculatus, C.\nmcdonaldi and C. hoskini by average sequence divergences of 14.28\u201316.43% (Table 2). Morphologically, it has\nmany more femoroprecloacal pores (57\u201364 vs 48 or fewer) and enlarged femoroprecloacal scales (56\u201365 vs 48 or\nfewer) than C. tuberculatus, C. mcdonaldi and C. hoskini. The hindlimbs are immaculate (vs mottled), and the cau-\ndal dark bands are solid black (vs dark-edged with paler centres) and are much wider than the pale interspaces at\nthe tail base (vs more nearly equal width). In comparison to all three species, C. adorus has much less developed\ntubercles, those that are present being smaller and less projecting than the other species, and the tubercles are much\nreduced on the tail, not reaching the third pale caudal band. In comparison to C. mcdonaldi, C. adorus has a contin-\nuous row of femoroprecloacal pores in males (vs broken into three segments). In comparison to the geographically\nclosest species, C. hoskini, C. adorus also has dark dorsal bands on the body that lack vertebral extensions.\nIn comparison to C. robustus, C. adorus is smaller (maximum SVL 123 vs 161 mm), has a much more boldly\ncontrasting and \"cleaner\" colour pattern, lesser development of tubercles, lacks dark speckling on the venter and\norange cloacal mucosa, and has fewer dorsal tubercle rows (21\u201324 vs 24\u201330), transventral scales (34\u201340, mean =\n37.0 vs 41\u201354, mean = 48.6; our counts on the type series of C. robustus); femoroprecloacal pores (57\u201364 vs\n75\u201385) and enlarged femoroprecloacal scales (56\u201365 vs 75\u201392), and a generally narrower head (HW\/HL 66\u201376%,\nmean = 71% vs 69\u201384%, mean = 77%).\nIn comparison to C. klugei, C. adorus is smaller (maximum SVL 123 vs 143 mm), has more dark body bands\nover the trunk (three vs usually two), pale lips (vs brown posterior supralabials), a more contrasting dorsal colour\npattern, fewer transventral scales (34\u201340 vs 43\u201349), and fewer femoroprecloacal pores (57\u201364 vs 66\u201376) and\nenlarged femoroprecloacal scales (56\u201365 vs 69\u201377).\nFor comparisons with C. pronarus, see that species.\nNatural history. Cyrtodactylus adorus was collected from a large granitic outcrop near the mouth of the Pas-\ncoe River (Fig. 23B) where it was most prevalent on rock faces in sheltered, sparsely vegetated crevices. The Wat-\ntle Hills sample came from a rocky, seasonal watercourse in monsoon forest. The Stanley Hill sample was collected\non rock in deeply piled granite boulder habitat festooned with vegetation (vines, ferns, umbrella trees) (C.

Mental wider than deep and a little to moderately narrower than\nrostral, bordered posteriorly by a single elongate pair of large postmentals. In 88% of specimens, these are sepa-\nrated anteriorly by a small to moderate, elongate scale that contacts the posterior edge of the mental (Fig. 10E\u2013F);\nthis scale may be derived from the fragmented median extension of the rostral. Infralabials anteriorly much larger\nthan adjacent gular scales, becoming smaller posteriorly, 11\u201313 (mode = 12 (50.0%), mean = 11.8, sd = 0.68, n =\n16).

The holotype of C. pronarus is a mature-sized male, with the following character\nstates of those variable for the taxon: SVL 113 mm, AGL 51 mm, TL 150 mm, TW 7.1 mm, HL 32.3 mm, HW\n21.8 mm, HD 11.1 mm, IN 4.0 mm, SL 12.8 mm, EN 9.7 mm, EYE 6.7 mm, EE 8.9 mm, EAR 2.1 mm, FLL 17.0\nmm, HLL 21.0 mm, lamellae below digits I\u2013V 9+11, 10+13, 12+15, 14+15, 10+15 respectively, supralabials 10,\ninfralabials 12, rows of dorsal tubercles 22, transventral rows 43, femoroprecloacal scales 62, and dark tail bands\n11.\nEtymology. From the Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc (pro = before) and \u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (naros = flowing), alluding to the blending of the\nanterior edge of the dark body bands with the preceding pale interspaces.\nDistribution. Known only from a small area of the McIlwraith Range, north-east of Coen, Queensland (Fig.\n21). The three localities are within 22 km of each other, and all are at about 500 m asl. It is possible that the species\noccurs at higher elevations \u2014 the known localities represent accessible high points in the McIlwraith Range.\nConservation status. This species has a small known distribution that is unlikely to be much more extensive.\nWe have no clear understanding of population size and under IUCN criteria regard it as Data Deficient. The large\nadult size and colourful pattern of this species may make it desirable for the illegal pet trade but it occurs in a\nremote, protected area that is largely inaccessible.\nComparison with other species (Table 6). Cyrtodactylus pronarus is morphologically and genetically most\nsimilar to C. adorus, differing from it genetically by 8.53% sequence divergence on average (Table 2). It is slightly\nlarger than C. adorus (SVL males 104.5\u2013126 mm vs 91.5\u2013119 mm, females 113\u2013132.7 mm vs 90.9\u2013123 mm), has\nmore numerous labial scales (supralabial modes 10 vs 9; infralabials 11\u201313 vs 10\u201311), the antebrachium lacks\ntubercles (small tubercles present in C. adorus); the dark nape band lacks an anterior vertebral extension (present in\nC. adorus); the dark body bands lack a sharply defined anterior edge, instead blending into the pale bands (sharply\ndefined anterior and posterior margins to dark body bands in C. adorus), and the dark bands on the tail are much\nwider than the pale interspaces (pale tail bands about a third the width of the dark bands, while those of C. adorus\nare about half the width of the dark bands). The two species are at present geographically separated by 135 km, but\nthe intervening ranges (northern McIlwraith Range, Table Range, Macrossan Range) and rock outcrops have been\npoorly surveyed for nocturnal reptiles.\nCyrtodactylus pronarus is more genetically distinct from C. tuberculatus, C. mcdonaldi and C. hoskini, with\naverage sequence divergences between 16.72% and 17.72% (Table 2). Morphologically, it differs from C. tubercu-\nlatus, C. mcdonaldi and C. hoskini in having many more femoroprecloacal pores and enlarged femoroprecloacal\nscales (58\u201366 vs 48 or fewer for both characters). The hindlimbs are immaculate (vs mottled), the caudal dark\nbands are solid black (vs dark-edged with paler centres) and are much wider than the pale interspaces at the tail\nbase (vs subequal width), and the lips are pale and immaculate, sharply contrasting with the brown face. In compar-\nison to all three species, C. pronarus has much less developed tubercles, those that are present being smaller and\nless projecting than the other species, and the tubercles are greatly reduced on the tail, ceasing prior to the distal\nend of the first dark caudal band. In comparison to C. mcdonaldi, C. pronarus also has a continuous row of femoro-\nprecloacal pores in males (vs broken into three segments). Cyrtodactylus pronarus also lacks vertebral extensions\nto the dark nape and body bands (present in C. hoskini), and has the anterior margins of the dark body bands diffus-\ning into the pale interspaces (vs with dark anterior margins in C. tuberculatus and C. hoskini). It is also much larger\nthan C. hoskini and C. mcdonaldi (SVL up to 133 mm vs 112 and 105 mm respectively) and a little larger than C.\ntuberculatus (maximum 120 mm).\nIt further differs from all other Australian Cyrtodactylus in usually having a small median scale (Fig. 10; prob-\nably a fragmented posterior portion of the mental) anteriorly separating the first pair of postmentals (a feature oth-\nerwise only seen in one individual of C. adorus).\n\f",
    "SHEA ET AL.\n56 \u00b7 Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press\nIn comparison to C. robustus, C. pronarus is smaller (maximum SVL 132 vs 161 mm), has lesser development\nof dorsal tubercles, has pale lips (vs mottled lips), the anterior margins of the dark body bands blend with the pale\nbands (vs anterior margins strongly defined by narrow dark then light band), lacks dark speckling on the venter and\norange oral and cloacal mucosa, and has fewer dorsal tubercle rows (20\u201324 vs 24\u201330), femoroprecloacal pores and\nenlarged femoroprecloacal scales (58\u201366 vs 75 or more for both characters), and a generally narrower head (HW\/\nHL 65\u201375%, mean = 69% vs 69\u201384%, mean = 77%).\nIn comparison to C. klugei, C. pronarus has more dark body bands over the trunk (three vs usually two), pale\nlips (vs brown posterior supralabials), anterior margins of dark body bands poorly defined (vs sharply defined),\nfewer transventral scales (35\u201345 vs 43\u201349), and fewer femoroprecloacal pores (58\u201366 vs 66\u201376) and enlarged fem-\noroprecloacal scales (58\u201366 vs 69\u201377)\nNatural history. Specimens collected at Peach Creek were living amongst large granite boulders along a\ndrainage line in well-developed rainforest (Fig. 28). Cyrtodactylus have also been seen in similar habitat at Birth-\nday Mountain. These are presumably also C. pronarus because of the close proximity of this locality to the McIl-\nwraith Range.\nStomach contents of six individuals were reported by Covacevich et al. (1996; as Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis).\nTen food items were reported: an unidentified centipede (Chilopoda), the spider Heteropoda jugulans (Heteropodi-\ndae), the scorpion Lychas sp. (Buthidae), unidentified moth (Lepidoptera), unidentified wasp (Vespidae), unidenti-\nfied cricket (Gryllidae), and four roaches (two Laxta sp., two large Calolampra sp., Blaberidae).\nFIGURE 28.

Within Australia, Cyrtodactylus tissue samples from twelve Queensland localities were origi-\nnally available from the Queensland Museum collection. These samples were from the southern end of the Chilla-\ngoe\u2013Mungana Caves, north to Stanley Island (in the Flinders Group, off Cape Melville) and to the McIlwraith\nRange on Cape York Peninsula. The initial trees derived from these samples revealed three major lineages within\nAustralia. We undertook further collecting, emphasising localities intermediate between geographically proximate\nlocalities of different lineages, and more extensive sampling from potential localities to the north of the McIlwraith\nRange. This expanded sampling resulted in additional material from nine new localities including Tozer's Gap (Iron\nRange National Park) and the Pascoe River area in the far north. For this taxonomic paper, we sequenced 22 Cyrto-\ndactylus individuals from 11 Queensland localities, which incorporate most of the currently known Australian dis-\ntribution (Fig. 2, Table 1).\nFIGURE 2. Geographic distribution of Cyrtodactylus specimens examined in this study. Open symbols represent localities\nfrom which genetic samples were obtained.\n\f",

    "SHEA ET AL.\n10 \u00b7 Zootaxa 3146 \u00a9 2011 Magnolia Press\nFor non-Australian populations, we sampled each of the five taxa described or redefined by Kraus (2008),\nincluding types of each species (C. louisiadensis, n = 1; C. klugei, n = 1; C. robustus, n = 1; C. tripartitus, n = 1; C.\nepiroticus, n = 2). Cyrtodactylus epiroticus is the only one of these taxa not confined to a single island and both\nsamples come from the type locality at the western extreme of its distribution (Mt Shungol). From the Solomon\nIslands, we obtained tissues or were provided with sequence data from three islands: Malaita (n = 1), New Georgia\n(n = 1) and Ysabel (n = 1, the holotype of C. salomonensis) (Fig. 2; Table 2). We also included samples or obtained\nadditional sequences from four other New Guinea and eastern Indonesian species (C. novaeguineae, n = 3, C.\nloriae, n = 1, C. sermowaiensis, n = 2, C. zugi, n = 2) and two more geographically distant species (C. angularis\n(Smith 1921), n = 1) from Thailand and C. jarujini Ulber 1993 (n = 1) from Lao People's Democratic Republic. We\nassumed that the latter two taxa would serve as outgroups. We were unable to obtain tissue samples from two spe-\ncies that had been placed in various previous concepts of a Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis group: C. murua and C.\nbiordinis.\nDNA extraction and sequencing. Total genomic DNA was extracted from all tissues using NucleoSpin Tissue\nKits (Macherey-Nagel). The entire ND2 gene (approx. 1038bp) was amplified in 2 fragments using the Macey et\nal. (1997) primer L4437 and HCyrlo4980 (5' ATY ATG CGG GTT TGT GTT TGG TT 3', this study) for the first\nfragment and LCyrlo4876 (5' TCA ACR TGA CAA AAA ATC GC 3', this study) and H5540 (Macey et al. 1997)\nfor the second fragment. Each 25 \u00b5l reaction contained 1x Taq polymerase buffer with a final concentration of 2.5\nmM MgCl2, 0.4 \u00b5M each primer; 0.8 mM dNTPs, 1% BSA and 0.65 U of Taq polymerase. The use of the hot start\npolymerase HotMaster Taq (5 Prime) required an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0 C for 2 min prior to the commencement\nof the remaining cycle parameters: 35 cycles of 94\u00b0 C for 20 sec, 52\u00b0 C for 20 sec, 65\u00b0 C for 30 sec and a final\nextension 65\u00b0 C for 5 min, 22\u00b0 C for 10 sec. Amplification conditions and PCR parameters were identical for each\nfragment.\nPCR products were either sequenced directly or gel purified (MoBio UltraClean Gel Spin kit). Sequencing\nreactions were carried out according to standard ABI PRISM dye-deoxy terminator sequencing protocols using Big\nDye Terminator version 1.3. Sequences from the new specimens have been deposited in GenBank nucleotide\nsequence database (see Table 2 for details of all samples and sequences used in this study including Genbank\naccession numbers). Chromatographs were checked and all sequences were aligned manually using Se-Al v2.0a10\n(Rambaut 1996).\nPhylogenetic analyses. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were carried out in MrBayes v3.1.2 (Ronquist &\nHuelsenbeck 2003) and posterior probabilities were calculated using a Markov chain, Monte Carlo (MCMC) sam-\npling approach. These analyses used the GTR (general time reversible model) + G (gamma distribution of rates)\nand I (proportion of invariant sites) model of sequence evolution, as determined by the Akaike and Bayesian infor-\nmation criteria (AIC and BIC) in jModeltest v0.1.1 (Guindon & Gascuel 2003; Posada 2008). By default MrBayes\nv3.1.2 performs two independent runs. We ran the analysis twice so that four independent runs were performed. For\neach run, starting trees were random and 4 simultaneous Markov chains were run for 2,000,000 generations with\ntrees sampled every 1000 generations resulting in a total of 8,000 saved trees over the four runs. Burn-in values for\neach run were set at 100,000 generations (100 trees) after empirical values of stabilizing likelihoods indicated that\nconvergence of the MCMC chains had been reached. A combined majority rule consensus tree from the four inde-\npendent runs, was generated in PAUP* v4.b.10 (Swofford 2002) by sequentially importing the four MrBayes tree\nfiles (.t files); excluding the first 100 trees of each tree file and retaining the previous 1900 trees in memory. The\nresulting consensus tree was therefore constructed from 7600 trees. The posterior probabilities on the consensus\ntree are indicated only where branch support is greater than 0.6 (Posada & Crandall 1998).\nMorphology\nSpecimen sources and character definitions. We examined all specimens (n = 274) referred to Cyrtodactylus lou-\nisiadensis or to species described from within that nominal species in the collections of the Australian Museum,\nSydney (AM), Queensland Museum, Brisbane (QM), South Australian Museum, Adelaide (SAM), Museum of\nVictoria, Melbourne (MV), American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH), Bishop Museum, Hono-\nlulu (BPBM) (some of which were later deposited in the Papua New Guinea National Museum, Port Moresby\n(PNGNM)), Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard, Cambridge (MCZ), and National Natural History\nMuseum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington (USNM).\n\f"
