A total of four specimens were caught by hook and line in 2009 and 2011 between 210\u2013220 m over\na rocky-sand bottom, only two were preserved. The species may also be endemic to the Philippines and inhabit burrows as do\nthe other known species of this genus. The combination of the following characters distinguish the new species from its conge-\nners: prominent dark predorsal ridge bordered by bright yellow-orange background (only B. semifasciatus from West Africa\nhas a more prominent and dark predorsal ridge, but the ridge has no underlying orange-yellow colour), a great body depth (28\u2013\n29% SL; other species of Branchiostegus, usually 27% SL) longer head length (30\u201331% SL; other species of Branchiostegus,\nusually 28%), greater head depth (26\u201327% SL; other species of Branchiostegus, usually 26% SL); long pre-dorsal length (35%\nSL; other species of Branchiostegus, usually 32% SL), and distinctive body, head and caudal fin colouration; skin over dorsal\ntips of branchiostegals characteristically bright yellow. A brief discussion of the status of tilefish systematics is included.\nKey words: Malacanthidae, Branchiostegus saitoi, Bayangas, Philippines, Branchiostegidae\nIntroduction\nA species of Branchiostegus was caught by hook and line off Batangas, Laiya, Philippines in 2009 and photo-\ngraphed by Mr. Jiro Saito, an amateur angler. The two initial specimens were eaten. An internet picture was discov-\nered by the junior author and brought to the attention of the then visiting senior author who recognized it as a new\nspecies. Contact of Mr. Jiro Saito by the junior author ultimately resulted in two additional specimens (over 1 kg\neach) caught in April, 2011 off Bayangas, Laiya, Philippines, photographed by Mr. J. Saito, then send frozen to the\njunior author. These specimens were again photographed, muscle samples taken then examined by the senior\nauthor and confirmed as belonging to a new species.\nSystematic background. The tilefishes (=Branchiostegidae) are comprised of three genera and 30 nominal\nspecies world-wide and are found along the edges of continental and oceanic plates as adults from warm temperate\nto tropical waters. Dooley (1978 & 1998), Dooley and Paxton (1975), Dooley and Kailola, (1988) and others con-\nsider the tilefishes as belonging to two related, but distinct families (Branchiostegidae and Malacanthidae) based on\nmorphological and molecular character differences. Tilefish belong to the deeper water tilefishes Branchiostegidae\n(generally inhabiting self constructed burrows, at around 200 m depths, species may range from 90\u2013500 m). The\nshallower water sand tilefishes (=Malacanthidae) consist of two genera and about 16 nominal species. They live in\nself-constructed mounds or burrows, generally from 5\u201350 m for Malacanthus. Some species of Hoplolatilus may\nbe found to 100 m depths. Recent molecular research tends to support a tilefish two-clade hypothesis (Jimenez,\n2007; Kelleperuma, 2009). An early paper explored the intrafamilial relationships of the family Branchiostegidae\nbased on comparative head myology (Marino and Dooley, 1982).\nBased primarily on a suggested synapomorphic larval chanaracter, other authors have consider the tilefishes as\nbelonging to a single family (Malacanthidae) with two subfamilies, Latilinae and Malacanthinae, (see: Johnson,\n1984, Nelson, 1984 & 2006; and Eschmeyer and Bailey, 1990). Tilefishes share somewhat similar spinous pelagic\n\f",
    "DOOLEY & IWATSUKI\n32 \u00b7 Zootaxa 3249 \u00a9 2012 Magnolia Press\nlarvae. Comparatively, the anguilliform eels comprising nearly 800 species and 15 families, share a similar leptoce-\nplalus larvae (Nelson, 2006). Imamura (2000) combined the Dactylopteridae with the tilefishes belonging to a sin-\ngle family with four subfamilies (including dactylopterids); this hypothesis has not been supported by most authors\n(Springer and Johnson, 2004).\nThe genus Branchiostegus presently is comprised of 17 nominal species (including three new and two doubtful\nspecies). These fishes are found in relatively deepwater usually over a mud-clay bottom (usually 90-200 m, but\nmay reach 600 m depths); they all live in soft bottom in self-constructed burrows as far know (Dooley, 1978). Spe-\ncies of Branchiostegus are found from west Africa (1 species), the Red Sea and Indian Ocean (7 species) and\nthrough the Indo-West Pacific (12 species). Dooley and Paxton (1975) described a new species from eastern Aus-\ntralia, Dooley (1978) described a new species from the East China Sea, and Sea of Japan, Dooley and Kailola\n(1988) described four new species from the eastern Indian Ocean (Australia) and reviewed the genus. Dooley\n(1998) also reviewed the tilefishes from the Indo-West Pacific. A review of the Korean and South China Sea spe-\ncies of Branchiostegus using molecular and osteological characters was published by Kim and Ryu (1998) and\nRyu, et al. (2009). A review and evolution of the genus is in progress by the present authors.\nFive species of the genus (B. japonicus. B. argentatus, B. auratus, B. sawakinensis and B. albus) are highly\nvalued commercial fish in Japan and in many countries bordering the South and East China Seas (Dooley, 2000).\nAnother species of Branchiostegus (possibly an endemic) from Okinawa, Japan previously recognized by Yoshino\net al., (1984), is being described by T. Yoshino and W. Hiramatsu of the University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa. The\nsenior author (JKD) examined specimens and skeletal material of this undescribed species while visiting the Uni-\nversity of the Ryukyus in Okinawa in 2010 and reviewed the manuscript of the description confirming its validity.\nAnother nominal species is being described from Vietnam (Hiramatsu, personal comm.). The Okinawan and Viet-\nnamese species are quite distinct from the new species being described herein.\nThe following nine Branchiostegus species are known from the South and East China Seas and vicinity:\n[Herre\u2019s 1926 and 1928 two species, B. vittatus and B. ilocanus respectively, described from the Philippines are\ndoubtful species and are not herein included]: B. japonicus, B. auratus, B. albus, B. argentatus, B. sawakinensis, B.\nwardi (northern and eastern Australia), B. sp. (Okinawa); Hiramatsu and Yoshino [2011, in press ], and the present\nspecies being described from the Philippines, and a new species being described by Hiramatsu from Vietnam. To\nfurther confuse identification of species of this genus, at least three Branchiostegus hybrids have also been col-\nlected from southwestern Japan (e.g. B. albus x B. japonicus, B. albus x B. auratus and B. japonicus x B. argenta-\ntus; see: Yamada, et al., 2007).\nSpecimens of Branchiostegus from the Philippines are very rare. Visits to numerous fish markets in Manila,\nPhilippines (where Herre, 1926, 1928 collected his two nominal species) and other cities during 1995 by the senior\nauthor failed to reveal any specimens of Branchiostegus. Herre\u2019s (1926, 1928) descriptions, drawings, counts and\nmeasurements were not distinct from other described species, and no specimens of these two species exist as far\nknown. Both of the holotypes were apparently destroyed during World War II. The two species (B. vittatus and B.\nilocanus ) described by Herre (1926, 1928) from the Philippines should both be considered as nomen dubium. The\nonly three verifiable Philippine species of Branchiostegus are: B. japonicus, B. sawakinensis and the present new\nspecies. B. argentatus, B. albus, B. auratus an B. argentatus may also exist, but records have not been verified\n(Dooley and Rau, 1982).\nMaterials and methods\nMeasurements were made with dial calipers to the nearest 0.5 mm and follow those defined by Hubbs and Lagler\n(1958), and modified by Dooley (1978). Cheek depth was measured from the lower orbital rim to the bottom mar-\ngin of the preoperculum. Measurements are expressed as percent standard length (SL) or percent head length (HL).\nVertebral counts and other internal meristics and characters were taken from radiographs.\nBranchiostegus saitoi sp. nov.\nHolotype.

Freshly preserved holotype 329 mm SL; photo by the second author.\nDistribution. Known only from Bayangas, Laiya, Philippines (130\n38.5\u2019 N, 1210\n25.6\u2019 E ) at 210\u2013220 M\ndepths, it is possibly endemic; but as it is very rare, and probably inhabits burrows as do other tilefishes, B. saitoi\nmay ultimately be found at other localities.\nEtymology. A new species of Branchiostegus was first caught off Batangas Laiya, Philippines in 2009, photo-\ngraphed and eaten. Two years passed before two more specimens were caught by J. Saito, an amateur angler from\nJapan in April, 2011. Without J. Saito\u2019s considerable efforts and interest, this species would have remained\nunknown. The new species is herein named in his honor.\n\f",
