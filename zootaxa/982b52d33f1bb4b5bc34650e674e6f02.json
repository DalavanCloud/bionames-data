It is the nineteenth member of the genus recorded from Thailand and the\neighth Thai Cyrtodactylus known to be a facultative troglophile.\nKey words: Thailand, Chiang Mai, Reptilia, Gekkonidae, Cyrtodactylus dumnuii, new species, taxonomy, cave-dwelling\nIntroduction\nBent-toed geckos of the genus Cyrtodactylus Gray are the most species-rich of all gekkotan genera, with\napproximately 120 species. Roughly half of these have been described in the last decade (Uetz 2010). The\ngreatest rate of new discovery in the group has been in Southeast Asia. For example, extensive recent work in\nVietnam has revealed nineteen, mostly endemic species, many associated with karst substrates or limestone\ncaves (e.g., Nazarov et al. 2008; Ngo 2008; Ngo & Bauer 2008; Ngo et al. 2008; Ziegler et al. 2010 and\nreferences therein). In Thailand Bauer et al. (2002) recognized 13 species of Cyrtodactylus. Another five\nspecies have subsequently been described from diverse localities around the country (Bauer et al. 2003;\nPauwels et al. 2004; Bauer et al. 2009; Sumontha et al. 2010), including several from limestone caves (see\nSumontha et al. 2010). We here describe another new Thai gecko from an area of limestone caves in the\nnorthwestern province of Chiang Mai.\nMaterial and methods\nThe following measurements were taken with digital calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm following the methods of\nBauer (2002, 2003): CrusL: crus length; EarL: ear length; EyeEar: eye to ear distance; ForeaL: forearm\nlength; HeadH: head height; HeadL: head length; HeadW: head width; Internar: internarial distance; Interorb:\ninterorbital distance; NarEye: nares to eye distance; OrbD: orbital diameter; SnEye: snout to eye distance;\nSVL: snout-vent length; TailL: tail length; TailW: tail width; TrunkL: trunk length. Basal subdigital lamellae\n\f",

Measurements\nand scale counts based on right side of animals unless otherwise noted. Scale counts and external observations\nof morphology were made using a Nikon SMZ1000 stereo dissecting microscope.\nComparisons were made with museum material in the collections of the California Academy of Sciences,\nSan Francisco (CAS), Chulalongkorn University Museum of Zoology, Herpetological Section, Bangkok\n(CUMZ R), Institut Royal des Sciences Naturelles de Belgique, Brussels (IRSNB), Khorat Zoo Museum,\nNakhonratchasima (KZM), Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts (MCZ), Thailand\nNatural History Museum, National Science Museum, Technopolis (THNHM), and United States National\nMuseum, Washington, D.C. (USNM). See Bauer et al. (2002, 2003, 2009), Pauwels et al. (2004), and\nSumontha et al. (2010) for lists of comparative specimens examined. Original published descriptions and\ndescriptions provided in broader faunal and taxonomic treatments (e.g., Smith 1935; Taylor 1963; Youmans &\nGrismer 2006; R\u00f6sler & Glaw 2008) were also consulted.\nCyrtodactylus dumnuii sp. nov.\nFigures 1\u20134.\nHolotype.

Six (left) to seven (right) tiny femoral pores in distal\nscales of enlarged femoral scales, separated by 10 (right) to 11 (left) poreless scales from precloacal series\n(Figure 3B). Postcloacal spurs each bearing three enlarged, smooth scales.\nScales on palm and sole smooth, rounded to oval or hexagonal, slightly domed. Scalation on dorsal\nsurfaces of limbs similar to body dorsum with enlarged, conical tubercles interspersed among smaller scales;\ntubercles separated from one another by 1\u20132 small scales, or in direct contact with one another. Fore and\nhindlimbs moderately long, slender (ForeaL\/SVL ratio 0.16; CrusL\/SVL ratio 0.20). Digits long, slender,\ninflected at interphalangeal joints, all bearing robust, slightly recurved claws. Basal subdigital lamellae broad,\novoid to rectangular, without scansorial surfaces (5-7-7-6-8 right manus; 6-7-7-9-8 right pes); narrow lamellae\ndistal to digital inflection and not including ventral claw sheath: 9-9-11-10-8 (right manus), 10-9-11-10-9\n(right pes); very weakly developed interdigital webbing between digits (except IV and V). Relative length of\ndigits: IV>III>II>V>I (manus); V>IV~III>II>I (pes). Mostly regenerated tail, long, slightly depressed, gently\ntapering to pointed tip; longer than SVL (TailL\/SVL ratio 1.23). Tail with enlarged median subcaudal plates.\nColoration in ethanol. Dorsum of alternating whitish to grayish-brown and chocolate brown transverse\nbands; chocolate bands with paler centers, grayish-brown bands often with darker centers. Six dark bands\nfrom shoulder to sacrum, another on tail base. Additional incomplete dark bands on nape and occiput. Dark\nbands fusing near ventrolateral margin of trunk. Most dorsal tubercles, except those on darkest brown areas,\nwhitish. Dorsum of head medium brown with irregular cream to grayish markings between occipital band and\nposterior margin of orbit. A chocolate brown stripe extends from lower posterior corner of orbit, forms a right\nangle above the tympanum, and passes medially to form the broken occipital band. A vague pale canthal\nstripe is present. Supra- and infralabials mottled brown and gray, darkest anteriorly.

Tail venter mottled gray-brown.\nColor in life (based on photographs of uncatalogued specimens, Figure 4) similar to that in preservative.\nIris green, rims of orbits and posterior supralabials pale yellowish to white.\nVariation. Comparative mensural data for the holotype and paratypes are given in Table 1. Meristic\ncharacters of the paratypes mostly correspond to those of the holotype except as noted. Rows of tubercles 18\u2013\n20 in paratypes (Tabler 1). Male paratype with six precloacal pores separated by 11 poreless scales from a\nseries of six femoral pores on each thigh. Female paratypes with no femoral pores and 0\u20137 precloacal pores\n(Table 1); if present, precloacal pores minute. Original portion of tail of CUMZ R 2009-6-24-6 weakly\ndifferentiated into annuli, with two subcaudal plates corresponding to eight rows of small, rectangular,\nsubimbricate dorsal scales, decreasing to seven, then six such rows posteriorly. Dorsally original tail with\ncream blotches separated by more extensive brown markings. THNHM 15905 with seven dark transverse\nbands between shoulders and sacrum. CUMZ R 2009-6-24-6 with occipital band complete, partly complete in\nCUMZ R 2009-6-24-5. In living non-type specimens (Figure 4) the slender original tail exhibits 13\u201314 ashy\nblotches or rings on a chocolate to purplish-brown background. Caudal tubercles are limited to the pygal\nportion of the tail only.\nComparisons with other species. As discussed by Bauer et al. (2009), a number of geographically\ncoherent and\/or phenotypically similar clusters of species of Cyrtodactylus have recently been recognized in\nthe literature. However, a comprehensive phylogenetic frame work for the group is still pending. We therefore\nprovide comparisons of C. dumnuii sp. nov. to all of the Cyrtodactylus species described as of 1 April 2010\n(exclusive of the distinctive South Asian Geckoella, sometimes considered as a subgenus of Cyrtodactylus,\nand a number of bent-toed geckos of questionable generic allocation occurring in Nepal, northern India, and\nTibet [Xizang Autonomous Region]).\nR\u00f6sler and Glaw (2008) provided an extensive table summarizing a diversity of features across nearly 100\nspecies of Cyrtodactylus sensu lato. Because of the incredible rate at which new Cyrtodactylus have been\ndescribed from southeast Asia, this set of comparisons is already somewhat outdated. Data from additional\ntaxa and corrections to R\u00f6sler and Glaw\u2019s (2008) data were derived from Oliver et al. (2008), Grismer &\n\f",

Finally, C. dumnuii\nalso differs from its most recently described Thai congeners; from C. erythrops Bauer et al. it is distinguished\nby its greater number of scales across the venter at midbody (40 versus 28), and from C. auribalteatus\nSumontha et al. it differs in having 6\u20137 (versus 4) dark bands from the shoulders to the sacrum.\nDistribution and natural history. Cyrtodactylus dumnuii has been collected only from a single locality\nnear the Myanmar border in Chiang Mai Province in the northwest of Thailand (Figure 5). Specimens were\ncollected inside the entrance and up to 30 m within Tham (Cave) Phabartmaejon (Figure 6), during daylight\nhours.\nDiscussion\nCyrtodactylus dumnuii is the nineteenth species of bent-toed gecko to be recorded from Thailand and like\nmany of its recently described congeners, both in Thailand and elsewhere in southeast Asia (e.g., Ziegler et al.\n2002 [2003], 2010; Hoang et al. 2007; Ngo 2008; Ngo et al. 2008; Nazarov et al. 2008; Bauer et al. 2009), it\nis a troglophile or facultative cavernicole (sensu Chapman 1985), often using caves as retreat sites or as\nsources of prey, but not absolutely dependent on the cave environment.\nIn addition to the many recently described species of Southeast Asian Cyrtodactylus, further undescribed\ntaxa have been identified throughout the region, including from elsewhere in Thailand (Sumontha, pers.\nobserv.). Phylogenetic studies of Cyrtodactylus have thus far been limited, but suggest that some taxa\noccurring in close geographic proximity to one another are also closely related (e.g., Welton et al. 2010;\nZiegler et al. 2010). Our own investigations based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Bauer et al.,\nunpublished) suggest that Thai cave geckos are relatively closely related to one another and that they are part\nof a larger clade of bent-toed geckos with closer affinities to Malaysian and Indochinese taxa than to those in\nMyanmar. However, taxa such as C. erythrops from Mae Hong Son Province and C. dumnuii sp. nov. from\nChiang Mai Province, both on the Myanmar border, will require careful scrutiny as it is expected that\nrepresentatives of both the Indochinese and Myanmar radiations of Cyrtodactylus could occur in this region.\n\f",
    "Zootaxa 2570 \u00a9 2010 Magnolia Press \u00b7 49\nNEW CYRTODACTYLUS FROM CHIANG MAI, THAILAND\nLike other limestone-dwelling geckos, C. dumnuii sp. nov. probably has a restricted distribution and\nshould be considered susceptible to localized threats and the evaluation of the conservation status of the new\nspecies should be a priority. Cyrtodactylus species are often attractive and many have entered the international\npet trade (Pauwels et al. 2004).\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Lt. Col.
