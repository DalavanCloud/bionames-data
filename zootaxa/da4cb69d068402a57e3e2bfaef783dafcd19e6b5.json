With nine\nspecies, the Kimberley region in northern Western Australia is the most diverse. Recent surveys of the northwest coast of\nthe Kimberley have revealed a tenth species of Uperoleia. The new species is characterized by a combination of small\nbody size, dark and slightly tubercular dorsal skin, basal webbing between the toes, outer metatarsal tubercle spatulate\nand oriented perpendicular to the foot, possession of maxillary teeth, a broadly exposed frontoparietal fontanelle and the\nadvertisement call is a high-pitched rasp. All specimens collected have been associated with sandstone boulders or\nescarpments with flowing water or rock pools. The northwest Kimberley is an isolated region of high rainfall and rugged\nterrain that possesses high biodiversity for many plant and animal groups and is therefore worthy of special conservation\nattention.\nKey words: frog, Uperoleia, call analysis\nIntroduction\nThe Myobatrachidae is a diverse family of small-bodied frogs from Australia and southern New Guinea (Lit-\ntlejohn et al. 1993; Tyler & Doughty (in press). Within the Myobatrachidae, the genus Uperoleia Gray, 1841\nis the most speciose with 25 currently recognized species. Uperoleia species are small (2-4 cm), squat and\nshort-limbed frogs that are typically drably coloured and terrestrial. They have moderately developed paro-\ntoid, dorsolateral\/inguinal and coccygeal glands which may be marked with orange or gold. There is usually a\nred or orange femoral and tibial patch that may function as \u2018flash\u2019 colouration when the legs are extended.\nAdvertisement calls are simple, consisting of rasps or clicks.\nUntil the revision of Uperoleia by Tyler et al. (1981a), confusion surrounded the distribution of the type\nspecies (U. marmorata Gray, 1841), the status of Glauertia and the number of species. Tyler et al. (1981a)\nrestricted the distribution of U. marmorata to the vague collection location of the holotype, synonymized\nGlauertia with Uperoleia and described nine new species (one of which, U. variegata Tyler, Davies & Martin,\n1981, was later synonymized by Tyler et al. 1986). Tyler et al. (1981b,c) described two more species and\nDavies and colleagues (Davies et al. 1985; Davies & Littlejohn 1986; Davies et al. 1986; Davies et al. 1993)\ndescribed eight more species. Recently, Young et al. (2005) described a small-bodied Uperoleia from just out-\nside the Darwin metropolitan area, underscoring the potential for further unrecognized diversity within the\ngenus.\nUperoleia are distributed chiefly in the wetter northern and eastern regions of Australia, but can penetrate\nmore arid regions, i.e. U. russelli Loveridge, 1933 and U. glandulosa Davies, Mahony & Roberts, 1985 in the\nPilbara region, U. micromeles Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981 in the northwestern deserts, U. trachyderma\nTyler, Davies & Martin, 1981 in the Northern Territory and U. capitulata Davies, McDonald & Corben, 1986\n\f",

The region with\nthe highest diversity of species is the Kimberley in northern Western Australia. The Kimberley is a diverse\nand rugged landscape that is isolated to the south by deserts and to the east by the geographic constriction of\nthe Cambridge Gulf. This region receives reliable and heavy tropical rainfall in the summer (December\u2013\nMarch). The southwestern Kimberley has three endemic species: U. aspera Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981, U.\nmjobergii Andersson, 1913 and U. talpa Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981. To the east are U. borealis Tyler,\nDavies & Martin, 1981, U. lithomoda Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981, and U. trachyderma, all three of which\nextend into the Northern Territory and U. lithomoda extends to Queensland and southern New Guinea. In the\nnorthwest Kimberley, U. borealis, U. crassa Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981, U. lithomoda, U. marmorata and\nU. minima Tyler, Davies & Martin, 1981 occur.\nSurveys specifically targeting frogs were conducted during summer wet seasons from 2005\u20132008 in the\nKimberley (Fig. 1). In January 2007, we went to the Prince Regent River area to look for U. marmorata and\nnew species of frogs. During the survey, the new species was recognized as such because its call differed from\ncongeners. In February 2008, more individuals were heard and collected on Katers Island in the far north\nKimberley. We describe the new taxon here based on its distinctive appearance and call.\nMethods\nMorphology\nWe examined and measured all nine available specimens of the new taxon in the Western Australian\nMuseum (WAM). All the specimens were male, except for one female and one metamorph of indeterminate\nsex. We measured the following characters: snout-urostyle length (SUL), head depth (HD \u2013 from top of head\nto jaw at level of the eyes), eye-naris distance (EN \u2013 from anterior corner of eye to posterior margin of naris),\ninterorbital distance (IO \u2013 from anterior corners), internarial distance (IN \u2013 from medial margins of nares), eye\nlength (EyeL), arm length (ArmL \u2013 from elbow to tip of 3rd\nfinger), tibia length (TL) and foot + tarsus length\n(FTL \u2013 from knee to tip of 4th\ntoe). Morphological characters of the head are limited in Uperoleia owing to\nextensive glands covering the tympana. One specimen (WAM R168040) was dissected to determine the extent\nof the frontoparietal fontanelle.\nFIGURE 1.

    "DOUGHTY & ROBERTS\n12 \u00b7 Zootaxa 1939 \u00a9 2008 Magnolia Press\nCall recording and analysis\nWe obtained high quality recordings of four males for analysis. Digital recordings were made using\nMarantz PMD 660 digital recorders with either Beyer M88 or AKG D880M\nmicrophones. Calls were analysed\nusing Raven Pro 1.3. We measured duration for various call components to the nearest ms. Frequency was\nanalysed using a Hann window, 1024 samples and we selected the peak frequency from a spectrum display\naveraged 10 times over an entire call.\nFrogs called in discrete bouts and we measured calls per bout and call rate (from the first to the last call in\nthe longest complete bout). For all other variables, we measured three consecutive calls from the middle of a\nbout and averaged values from all three calls for a single frog. For each call we measured duration, pulse num-\nber, pulse rate (averaged over whole call) and peak frequency also averaged over the whole call. We have\nreported a whole call average for ease of comparison. Temperature was measured as air temperature at the\ncalling site.\nIn one of the four recordings, high background noises and\/or reverberation obscured pulse structure as the\nmale was calling in a rock crevice sitting just above flowing water so pulse rate and pulse number were not\nmeasured. In one other recording, the male called intermittently and we could not define a bout structure so\nthere were no call rate data.\nTaxonomy\nUperoleia Gray, 1841\nType species: U. marmorata, by monotypy.\nDiagnosis.

In life, specimens from the mainland had a dorsum with background shade ranging from a\ncharcoal black to dark brown, with scattered small darker blotches and faint barring on the limbs. There is a\nzone stippled with pale bluish-white from the tip of the snout, posterior through the loreal region and extend-\ning along the sides; also on the undersurfaces of the limbs. There is a subtle wash of orange-red on the dor-\nsum, including more conspicuous blotches on the parotoid glands, the anterior tip of the snout, submandibular\nglands, vertebral zone of dorsum and upper arms. The fingers and toes are a creamy white. The ventral surface\nis a dull white peppered with small dark spots; the abdomen lacks the dark spots or white pigment altogether.\nThe margin of chin is only slightly more pigmented than the rest of the chin and ventral surface.

In (b) we manipulated contrast, brightness and spectrum window dis-\nplay to maximise the loudest frequency components over pulse structure and side-bands arising from pulse rate (see Ger-\nhardt & Huber, 2002).\nHabitat. At Bachsten Creek, U. micra were calling in moist crevices in sandstone rock faces high on a\nridge. One male was seen calling at the back of a narrow crevice sitting just above a broad sheet of shallow,\nflowing water (Fig. 2D). Other calling males were collected in crevices and cracks in rock faces with slowly\nflowing water from seepages among vegetation and litter. Other species calling within a few meters were U.\nborealis and U. crassa in a flooded grassy area and Limnodynastes lignarius (Tyler, Martin & Davies, 1979)\nalong a rocky creek. On Katers Island, U. micra was encountered in a low valley near the top of an extensive\nsandstone plateau. Males were calling from a hard-capped sandstone surface with slow-flowing water forming\nsmall pools among Triodia clumps. Other species that were calling at the same sites were U. borealis and L.\nlignarius. At both sites, males were encountered after heavy early evening showers which may have stimu-\nlated calling. The individual collected from near the Walcott Inlet was found on a high flat sandstone rock\nplatform (M. Barrett, pers. comm.).\nDistribution. Only known to occur in the high rainfall zone (> 1000 mm\/year) of the northwest Kimber-\nley, Western Australia (Fig. 1). On the mainland, from the Prince Regent River Nature Reserve south to Wal-\ncott Inlet. Also on Katers Island.\nEtymology. Derived from the Greek mikros, alluding to this species\u2019 small size and to the nearby U. min-\nima which is similar in size and external appearance. Used as an adjective.\nComparisons with other species. Uperoleia is a genus characterized by low morphological diversity.\nNevertheless, U. micra is distinguished from congeners from a combination of internal and external charac-\nters as well as call structure. The small (~ 2 cm) body size rules out U. marmorata (30.1 mm; Tyler et al.\n1981a). Within the genus, only U. daviesae Young, Tyler and Kent, 2005 has both the presence of maxillary\nteeth and a broadly exposed frontoparietal fontanelle like U. micra. This species also shares tubercular skin\nand basal webbing, but can be distinguished from U. micra by light grey dorsum with faint purple tone,\n\f",

In addition, U. daviesae\nhas only been found in flooded grasslands (versus sandstone boulders and escarpments) and although its call\nis similar to U. micra, it has fewer pulses and a lower pulse rate (Table 1).\nThe most similar Kimberley species in external appearance to U. micra is U. minima which occurs at\nMitchell Plateau and may prove to be sympatric with U. micra (see Fig. 1). Both species have small body size,\ndark mottled coloration, pale speckled venter and tubercular skin. They can be distinguished, however, by the\nfollowing external traits. In U. minima, the dorsal tubercles are denser and often form short scapular folds in\nsome specimens; in U. micra the tubercles are less dense and lower. In U. micra, the outer metatarsal tubercle\nis elongate and orientated perpendicular to the foot (Fig. 3D); in U. minima this tubercle is round (Fig. 3E). In\nU. micra, males have few markings on the chin; in U. minima there is a conspicuous dark pigmentation bor-\ndering the edge of the jaw. Internally, U. micra has maxillary teeth and a broadly exposed frontoparietal fon-\ntanelle, whereas U. minima lacks teeth and has well-developed frontal bones.\nCalls of U. micra can be readily distinguished from other Kimberley species. Uperoleia aspera, U. litho-\nmoda, U. minima and U. trachyderma have a much shorter call duration and lower pulse numbers (Table 1b);\nthe calls sound like \u2018clicks\u2019 to the ear. Uperoleia borealis, U. crassa and U. mjobergii have much longer call\ndurations and higher pulse rates (Table 1b); the calls sound like a short rasp or grate. The call of U. talpa has a\nsimilar pulse rate to U. micra but much lower frequency and higher pulse number. The calls of all eight Kim-\nberley species are clearly discrete in two or more characters. The variation in temperature between sets of\nrecording was 3.9\u00baC, but temperature is unlikely to have affected any metric used to differentiate calls over\nthat small a range. For example, pulse rate in U. laevigata Keferstein, 1867 of eastern Australia is strongly\ntemperature dependent, but the regression coefficient is only 5.56 which would generate a maximum incre-\nment in pulse rate of 21.7 between the high and low temperatures compared here (data reported as U. rugosa\nAndersson, 1916 by Robertson 1986; Davies & Littlejohn 1986). The only other Uperoleia species known\nfrom the Kimberley is U. marmorata, but no call data are available.\nRemarks. The discovery of another species of Uperoleia brings the total number of species in the genus\nto 26. This is the second-largest genus of Australian frog after Litoria. Continued exploration of remote areas\nof the Kimberley and revision of Uperoleia using morphology, genetics and call data may reveal further spe-\ncies.\nThe new species has only been found at four locations in the high rainfall zone of the northwest Kimber-\nley. This area is rich with terrestrial vertebrate species, including frogs, lizards, snakes and mammals (Storr &\nSmith 1975; Smith & Johnstone 1991). Biological surveys continue to discover new species of vertebrates\nwith regularity, including other new species of frogs (Doughty & Anstis 2007; Doughty et al. in press). Inver-\ntebrate and plant species are being discovered at even higher rates (e.g. McKenzie et al. 1991; Barrett 2006;\nHarvey & Edward 2007). These findings indicate that the true biodiversity of the region is underestimated.\nWith recent interest in increasing mining, agriculture and tourism in the region, it is essential that large areas\nare set aside in managed reserves to ensure protection of both described species and additional new species\nawaiting discovery and description.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Alcoa of Australia for funding the Western Australian Museum\u2019s Alcoa Frog Watch program and\nthe Department of Environment and Conservation\u2019s (DEC) Kimberley Islands Survey for funding the field-\nwork.
