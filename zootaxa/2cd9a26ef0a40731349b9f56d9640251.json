AMATO,2 AND MARCELO KNOFF2\n1 Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuaria do Estado de Mato Grosso S.A.,U.E.P., Rua do Pintado, s\/no.,\nCaixa Postal 941, Varzea Grande, Mato Grosso, Brasil and\n2 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Km 47 Antiga Rodovia Rio-Sao Paulo,\nCaixa Postal 74.512, Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil\nABSTRACT: Hysterolecitha brasiliensis sp. n. is described from the stomach and occasionally the intestine of\nMugil liza Valenciennes, 1836, from Rio da Guarda and the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro. This species\nis characterized by the relativelythick tegument; presence of tegumental plications; rounded and well-developed\npars prostatica, surrounded by numerous prostatic cells; true seminal receptacle; uterine seminal receptacle; and\na conspicuous genital atrium. It is distinguished from H. elongata Manter, 1931, by the shorter hindbody, the\nlonger forebody, the well-developed pars prostatica, larger eggs, and the true seminal receptacle. Of the more\nthan 18 species described known to date, it is most similar to H. pseudorosea (Bravo-Hollis, 1956) Yamaguti,\n1971, because of the possession of a true and a uterine seminal receptacle but differs by the shape of the body,\nposition of genital pore which is immediately posterior to pharynx, the larger true seminal receptacle, and egg\nsize (24-43 [mean = 36] by 16-22 [mean = 19] MIC-\nKEY WORDS: Hysterolecitha brasiliensis sp. n., Hemiuridae, digenetic trematodes, Mugil liza, mullet, Rio de\nJaneiro, Brasil.\nThe fishes of the family Mugilidae have broad\ngeographic distribution, occurring in the tropical\nand subtropical waters of the world, mainly re-\nstricted to the coastal estuarine waters. They are\nhosts of a large number of trematode species,\nand due to the constant migration between ma-\nrine and freshwaters, were attributed by Manter\n(1957), as being ecological bridges between trem-\natodes of freshwater and those of coastal marine\nwaters.\nIn the present work wedescribe Brasilian spec-\nimens from 2 different environments in the state\nof Rio de Janeiro as a new species of Hystero-\nlecitha.\nMaterial and Methods\nThe fishes from Rio da Guarda (RG) watershed\n(22\u00b045'S and 23\u00b000'S, 43\u00b050'W) were caught by the first\nauthor and professional fishermen, employees of the\nW. O. Neitz Parasitological Research Station, Univer-\nsidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro. The fishes\nfrom the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro (CRJ)\n(22\u00b000'S, 44\u00b000'W) were caught by commercial trawl-\ners. The trematodes were collected following thegen-\neral technique described by Amato (1985), fixed in\nalcohol-formalin-acetic acid (AFA) under slightcov-\nerslip pressure, stained with Mayer's Carmalum or De-\nlafield's Hematoxylin, and cleared with beechwood\ncreosote. The prevalence and the intensity of infection\nare indicated as follows, for each station: no. of hosts\npositive for H. brasiliensis\/no. of hosts examined: size\nof each infrapopulation.The drawings were made with\na drawing tube and a Leitz Dialux 20 EB microscope.\nAll measurements are in micrometers unlessotherwise\nstated; ranges of measurements are followed by the\nmean values within parentheses. Type specimens were\ndeposited in the Helminthological Collection of the\nInstitute Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro (IOC\/FIO-\nCRUZ) and at the Harold W. Manter Laboratory, Uni-\nversity of Nebraska State Museum, The University of\nNebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A.\n(HWML).\nResults\nHysterolecitha brasiliensis sp. n.\n(Figs. 1-3)\nDESCRIPTION (based on 11 specimens from Rio\nda Guarda): Body elongated, with anterior ex-\ntremity attenuated, without ecsoma, 1.8-6 (4.3)\nmm longby 399-1,015 (774)wide at acetabulum\nlevel.

(1967).\nSPECIMENS DEPOSITED: IOC\/FIOCRUZ Nos.\n32287 (holotype), and 32288 a, b (paratypes);\nHWML No. 20772 (paratype).\nDiscussion\nOverstreet (1973), comparing material from\nthe Gulf of Mexico with that of Manter (1931)\nfrom Beaufort, North Carolina and that of Tra-\nvassos et al. (1967), discussed fully the characters\nof\/\/, elongata. He mentioned the differences ob-\nserved between his material and Manter's.\nOverstreet suggested that the Brasilian material,\nhesitantly described by Travassos et al. (1967)\nas H. elongata probably could be considered a\ndifferent and new species in relation to that de-\nscribed from North America.\nAccording to Overstreet (1973) the Brasilian\nspecimens differ from H. elongata by having\nlarger suckers, a longer forebody, larger eggs, nu-\nmerous prostatic cells within the hermaphroditic\nsac, a genital atrium, and a true seminal recep-\ntacle. We agree with Overstreet (1973), with the\nexception of the prostatic cells inside the her-\nmaphroditic sac which we were not able to see,\nand in relation to the uterine seminal receptacle\nwhich he might have not seen because of the large\nquantity of eggs sometimes present. This also\nhappens in our material.\nHysterolecitha brasiliensis sp. n. is character-\nized by having tegumental plications; well-de-\nveloped, rounded pars prostatica surrounded by\nnumerous prostatic cells; a true seminal recep-\ntacle which is rounded and well developed; the\nproximal portion of the uterus containing a large\nquantity of spermatozoa, characterizing the uter-\nine seminal receptacle; and finally, a conspicuous\ngenital atrium. The seminal vesicle is not bipar-\ntite although it shows in Figure 1 as if it were.\nThis is due to the position in which the specimen\nwas killed. The drawing in Figure 3, made from\nanother specimen, clearly shows that the seminal\nvesicle is saccular.\nAccording to King and Noble (1961) the true\nseminal receptacle is a structure which is lacking\nin the majority of the species of Hysterolecitha\nwith the exception of H. pseudorosea (Bravo-\nHolis, 1956) Yamaguti, 1971, even though Ya-\nmaguti (1971) did not include the character in\nhis generic diagnosis.\nHysterolecitha brasiliensis differs from H.\nelongata mainly by the possession of a longer\nforebody and a shorter hindbody, by the well-\ndeveloped and rounded pars prostatica sur-\nrounded by numerous prostatic cells, by having\nboth rounded and well-developed seminal re-\nceptacle and uterine seminal receptacle, and by\nthe conspicuous genital atrium.\nAmong the more than 18 species so far de-\nscribed in the genus, H. brasiliensis is more sim-\nilar to H. pseudorosea due to the presence of a\ntrue seminal receptacle and a uterine seminal\nreceptacle. It differs in the shape of the body, the\npresence of tegumental plications, the position\nCopyright \u00a9 2011, The Helminthological Society of Washington\n\f",

(1967) as M. plat-\nanus Giinther, 1880, is incorrect. According to\nMenezes (1983), M. platanus occurs from Rio\nde Janeiro to Argentina and has a color pattern\nidentical to M. liza. If this is true, H. brasiliensis,\nso far, has been collected from only 1host species,\nM. liza.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Delir Correa Gomes for the loan\nof specimens deposited at the Helminthological\nCollection of the Fundacao Institute Oswaldo\nCruz, Rio de Janeiro and Dr. Naercio Menezes,\nof the Universidade de Sao Paulo, for the iden-\ntification of the fish hosts.
